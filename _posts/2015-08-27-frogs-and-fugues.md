desert rains abate. Now crickets join frogs in fugues.
How can any evil out-live this eternal creation that is always new?
We dug our trenches, collecting water for trees,
birds, insects, and animals all around.
Our home is an island of hope for many now.
Our trenches are a defense in war
against the elite above who annihilate us below.
Be careful harming those below, for how low does their consciousness go,
those who hear frogs and fugues?
