The year before last was at the height of this so-called narco war in Northern Mexico. The narcos controlled the whole region and the local village. There was a command center 2 kilometers from our home where there were human skulls hung on the fence. Many of the local men were hired as lookout scouts to inform them if there was going to be an attack. The people in the village were very destitute and poor. Many families had inadequate food and clothing while the men spent their money on beer or crack.

Rancho Misterio began organizing some social service activities in the community. We even organized a mass with a very good Catholic Father in which the chanting of Baba Nam Kevalam was incorporated into a mass which the father gave. Giitanjali continued to take our crew to sing kiirtan twice a week with the community members. I usually stayed behind in the ranch with the heavy artillery in deep meditation and confident that nothing evil could befall my family. During that time the locals would pray to the Virigin of Guadalupe before and after singing kiirtan. During those times my meditation was so full of beautiful Christian ideas. I felt so closely the divine, motherly aspect of the divinity. She never appeared as a form, but rather the love that fills all space between all of the stars of the universe. At that time I realized the Virgin of Guadalupe has a shawl bedecked with stars and that the image is really a mix between an indigenous goddess and the Virgin Mary. I never really knew much of Catholicism personally but always knew many very good Catholic people. In my own way I had many internal apparitions and it was nice to feel like I understood the underlying meaning of the Divine Mother behind this image.

At that same time, there was an apparition of the Virgin of Guadalupe over the village. Everybody who wasn't drunk saw it; that is, all of the women and maybe one or two of the men.
What I learned from this is that the divine cannot ultimately be trapped in any image but rather may use images to express deep truths.
