We belong to the golden race.

We come down to share grace.

Seeing all beings

Whatever tone or hue,

Bringing Light of Truth,

Taking every mind

Back to You.

Only to You.

Baba Nam Kevalam.......

One can't hold onto your world.

World escapes free,

Through one's every word.

Just hear our verse

Through your universe

And turn our golden light

Into purest white.

As we go

Only to You

Back to You

Only to You
