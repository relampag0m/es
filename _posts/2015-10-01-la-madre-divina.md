The year before last was at the height of this so-called narco war in Northern Mexico. The narcos controlled the whole region and the local village. There was a command center 2 kilometers from our home where there were human skulls hung on the fence. Many of the local men were hired as lookout scouts to inform them if there was going to be an attack. The people in the village were very destitute and poor. Many families had inadequate food and clothing while the men spent their money on beer or crack.

Rancho Misterio began organizing some social service activities in the local community with distribution of food and clothing. We teamed up with some very progressive priests who were working in the area. We even organized a mass with a very good Catholic Father in which the chanting of Baba Nam Kevalam was incorporated into a mass which the father gave. “Baba Nam Kevalam” is a Sanskrit mantra chanted by yogis before meditation. It means “Only Love Is.” It was a beautiful confirmation for the father to confirm that there is only one god of love while explaining the mantra to his Christian flock before the mass.

Giitanjali continued to take our crew to chant kiirtan (Baba Nam Kevalam) twice a week with the community members. I usually stayed behind in the ranch with the heavy artillery in deep meditation and remained confident that nothing evil could befall my family. They felt that as long as I remained in deep meditation while they were helping people that everything would be alright. As such, they would enter the community. During those sessions the locals would pray to the Virigin of Guadalupe before and after singing kiirtan with us. During those times my meditation was so full of beautiful ideas about the motherly, feminine aspect of the deity. These are symbolic qualifications. I never call god “Him” nor “Her.” However, I felt so closely the divine, motherly aspect of the divinity protecting us. “She” never appeared as a form to me, but rather the love that fills all space between all of the stars of the universe. At that time that I felt my mind expanding into infinite space I realized the form of the Virgin of Guadalupe has a shawl bedecked with stars.

The Virgin of Guadalupe isn’t an original image and its historical authenticity is very dubious. However, the image in itself speaks of great truths. She is really a synthesis between an indigenous Meso-American goddess and the Virgin Mary. She is a unique symbol of the Divine Mother as the Mother of Stars. At least this goddess image has a connection to nature and a live universe full of stars. It is hard to imagine Her sublimity trapped in some little church. In my own way I had these internal apparitions and it was nice to feel like I understood something of the meaning of the Divine Mother behind this image that I have no experience of nor personal attachments for. It is another affirmation that the divine cannot ultimately be trapped in any single image but rather may use these universal images to express such deep truths about the Supreme Consciousness.

At that same time, there was an apparition of the Virgin of Guadalupe over the village. Everybody who wasn’t drunk or high saw it; that is, all of the women and maybe one or two of the men.
