    <p>“Brahma alone is the guru.” This saying from the Upanishad represents a very universal conception of the deity. Brahma literally means that which is great and makes others great. In other words, Brahma is the Consciousness of the Macrocosm, of the entire universe. The guru is none other than the Supreme Consciousness and cannot be tainted by partiality nor prejudices nor any relative projection of a messiah or human guru. What is, simply is. <!--more-->If the Supreme Consciousness can create this entire universe, then surely there is an unmediated, direct way to communicate with me, a little microcosm in this Macrocosm. “Am I a secluded figure, in the vast, a little ameagre? No no no no I am not alone, the great is with me.”</p>

    <p>In the Tantra that I learned, Raja Di Raja Yoga, the techniques were very effective in awakening the kundalini. I began to enter the breathless state of samadhi very regularly when I was 23 years old. Although very intense, the practices gave the mind and body the maximum amount of transformation biologically, psychologically, and spiritually possible. <!--more-->However, nobody ever effectively taught me how to bring the kundalini back down. For years I was like a machine working at accelerated capacity. Sometimes I would go into trances while driving and my friend would have to grab the wheel. I would sometimes fall down and swoon while in a spiritual mood. My body once leaped 2 feet into the air when the kundalini awakened while I was sitting in the lotus posture. I cannot jump anywhere near that high in lotus if I try with my best effort and even when using my knees to bounce. This constant rising of the kundalini in me effected others as well, mostly for the good, but also negatively as well.</p>

    <p>I feel certain that the solution to the electromagnetic imbalances that are so greatly affecting the collective consciousness of the planet is quite simple and clear: take refuge in a higher ground. This planet maintains a balance with gravitational and electromagnetic forces by which our consciousness, a complex process involving the glandular and nervous system as well as the mind and Consciousness, has evolved and adapted over millions of years. Despite the fact that many people are having some severe problems of maladaptation to these new conditions, there is a great potential to make some huge leaps in personal and collective awareness.</p>

    <p>From the study of history, it is known that the Rgveda was composed outside India, mainly in Central Asia and Russia. The Yajurveda was written mostly outside India; only a portion was written in India. And the Atharvaveda was composed in Afghanistan and India. Those three Vedas – Rk, Yaju and Atharva – long afterwards, say about 3500 years ago – were edited and divided into different branches by Maharśi Krśńadvaepáyana Vyása. The oldest compositions were named Rgveda, the intermediate portions were called Yajurveda, and the remaining portions were named Atharvaveda. The last-named Veda was named after the great sage, Atharva, the first author of this Veda. And by compiling the musical compositions of the three Vedas, yet another Veda - the Sámaveda, the fourth Veda – was created. Sáma in Sanskrit means “musical composition”. The Sámaveda itself is not a Veda.</p>

    <p>I have a friend, a recluse yogi, who has the ability to heal any disease. He is still alive, but considering the state of collective insanity on the planet, that could very well change. These big brothers have too much burden to carry right now. So that a little dharmic, moral order can begin to influence human society again, there must first be some major cleansing. He says that people trapped in the human, materialistic urban matrices are becoming physically and mentally ill due to the inability to harmonize their physical, mental, and spiritual strata of existence with society, nature, the planet and the universe. This recluse friend doubts if modern humans really are fit to continue evolving on this planet. His opinion matters because to me because I have seen him heal many incurable diseases simply by looking at somebody. These people healed aren’t patients because he isn’t a healer, at least he doesn’t consider himself one. They are just people who happen to cross his path at the opportune time. I dare not give away his identity or his whereabouts because the people would devour him with their troubles.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Dada Iishvarakrsnananda or “Dada I.K.” was my meditation and yoga teacher when I was in Ananda Marga. He was the most humane and friendly person I have ever known. I continue to admire his moral courage and feel that his sincerity, discernment, and pure intentions are a great inspiration for many. This is a story he wrote the other day. Its setting is in an intense political atmosphere in India after Anandamurti had refused to stop speaking about PROUT, a decentralized economic theory that he propounded. The communists in the West Bengal state government are attacking Anandamurti and killing his followers while at the same time the Federal, pro-capitalist government is also trying to ban his social activity. PROUT was too transcendental for both the commie state and the Federal pro-capitalist governments and Anandamurti was getting flack from both the Right as well as the Left. Anandamurti’s institution, Ananda Marga Pracaraka Samgha, was later infiltrated by the CBI (which is like the CIA, only Indian). Many of his closest disciples betrayed him while others, like my friend Iishvarakrsnananda, went to jail in his teenage years for refusing to renounce these ideas even though he would have been given a presidential pardon and release for doing so. Many of his friends were brutally tortured and he himself almost died in jail but never renounced his principles. I have never known men with such clarity of purpose as I have known in Dada I.K.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Pluma Blanca always had a very elevated vibration. When people came near him they would begin to sway in a counter-clockwise direction. Sometimes their heads would begin to tilt and subtly twirl in an almost imperceptible circular motion. He explained that whether you are speaking of the Cosmic Nucleus of Hunab Ku or the Conscious Nucleus of the Atman radiating behind our minds, the movement around either a physical or spiritual nucleus is always a play of the centripetal and centrifugal forces. They have the same dynamics on all planes of being. There are physical vortexes of motion in the physical world where there is the weight and gravity of matter and also vortexes of subtle, mental energy that act and interact with thoughts, feelings, and perceptions. To harmonize the macrocosm with the microcosm, the universe with the individual, one must find this secret flow of Tao both within the mind and in one’s world, planet, and its plants and animals.
On the outside Pluma Blanca’s ancestors studied the movement of the planets and the natural cycles. This practice was never disconnected to the internal practice of meditation. Meditation is the science of seeing behind all of the vortexes and movements of the human mind. A mind that is pure sees into and understands the movements around Hunab Ku, the Cosmic Nucleus that is within us all. Every human being that has truly searched has seen into this great treasure deep within a balanced human existence. We understand that there is always something pure, eternally renewed when we live in harmony with creation. This inspiration has never abandoned us, only we have forgotten It.</p>

    <p>This creation of five fundamental factors is the crudest manifestation of Macrocosmic Citta or Cosmic Mental Stuff. During the introversial phase of the Cosmic Mind, or pratisaiṋcara, the quinquelemental factors came in touch with the divine powers of Puruśottama, the Supreme Knowing Entity, and developed the vibrations of life. The more this vital energy received the brilliance of Brahma or Supreme Consciousness, the more enlightened it grew, and this glow led it forward on the path of self-realisation. The highest of the thinking creatures have been able to accelerate the speed of their unit consciousness ahead of the speed of attraction, or the introversial phase of Brahma. The highest living being was called a human being or mánuśa, which means an intellectual being.</p>

    <p>I was an admirer of the Zapatistas since the first videos that I saw early in 1994 when Commander Ramona, an ex-nun Zapatista rebel commander, led the attack to take San Cristobal de las Casas in Chiapas. Even though they had machine guns and were fighting and killing I could see that they were very dignified people by the look in their eyes behind their masked faces. The noble eyes behind their masked faces as well as the brightly-colored indigenous clothing underneath bullet belts and machine guns revealed who these rebels truly were: organic farmers. I felt there was an invisible grace guiding them. I didn’t quite know why, but I just felt this very strongly as a first impression. It was a very lucid realization for me that awakened a strong sense of social and moral responsibility and activism. Later, the brilliant, humane discourses of the Zapatista commanders and sub-commanders like Ramona and Marcos revealed that there was such a beautiful and humane spirit guiding them. They won so many hearts around the world with their earnest discourse. Although I was a student in the U.S., I was drawn to them and attended some talks by Liberation Theologists priests that were Zapatista sympathizers who came to speak at the University of Texas at Austin.</p>

    <p>The year before last was at the height of this so-called narco war in Northern Mexico. The narcos controlled the whole region and the local village. There was a command center 2 kilometers from our home where there were human skulls hung on the fence. Many of the local men were hired as lookout scouts to inform them if there was going to be an attack. The people in the village were very destitute and poor. Many families had inadequate food and clothing while the men spent their money on beer or crack.</p>

    <p>Shame bears a resemblance to the vrtti, lack of confidence, in the second vortex.  The difference between them is that with lack of confidence there is a generalized, pervasive inferiority regarding one’s fundamental self-concept. Shame is a contraction of the expanding Manipura personality due to a disruption in one’s self-image.  The punitive and oppressive feeling of blame and the corresponding self and/or social judgment of the ego being inferior, a failure, unworthy, ill, base, sinful, etc. are due to activities and interactions of the ego that have transgressed social forms or boundaries or have failed to meet the expectations of the social environment.  </p>

    <p>In ancient Indian Tantra Yoga the mental ideation or concentrated thought for the practice of meditation is taught as “I am That” or “I am Brahma.”  For the extroverted mind without intuition of the Supreme Subjectivity of the Atman it is quite necessary to use an objective mental concept like a mantra to refer to “That,” the mystery of mysteries, especially in the beginning.  Who understands silence and what lies embedded in the silence underneath the wavering, coquettish mind?  Without an objective, descriptive idea of the Supreme Subjectivity with the qualities of love, light, bliss, or even a personal being with human-like qualities, this contemplation of the Atman is impossible for most.  It is only when the mind has matured and internalized and understood the problems and complexes related with the personality and its external, social world and has developed intuition and self-reliance in spiritual and existential affairs that it is possible to begin to understand the Atman or Supreme Subjectivity as a “This” instead of a “That.”</p>

    <p>My mother once told me of an incident when she was with her mother in a grocery store in Alabama in the early sixties. They arrived at the end of the check-out line. The people waiting in front of them were all black ladies who were waiting for their turn to pay at the register. As convention would have it, the ladies left their position and tried to get behind my grandmother at the end of the line. My grandmother wouldn’t let them. She said that they were there first and that they should go ahead of her. The other white people were offended by this. What is another white person coming in here for and breaking the rules of our established order?, they said. This happened in the early sixties before the Civil Rights Movement.</p>

In actual fact they are only making excuses in order to avoid their responsibilities. At the same time, however, I should add that most teachers demonstrate, through their mental outlook or their actions, far less awareness of their social responsibilities than concern for their own interests. They do not devote even a fraction of the time and energy to building society that they spend making money by any means possible, such as by writing “made easies” [course summaries] or study guides.

    <p>The inner spirit of the word samája [“society”] is “to move together”. That is, the vitality of society depends on two factors: its existence – a collective creation – and its inherent dynamism. The characteristic of an activating force is that it does not move in a perfectly straight line, rather its movement is rhythmic or undulating; and this rhythm or wave is not monomorphic but systaltic. The force that moves society forward is also systaltic. When the nature of movement of individual life does not hinder the rhythm of collective movement of society, there remains the possibility of forming a society from the collective movement of numerous individuals – there lies the possibility of creating a universal intellectual structure inspired by the brilliance of sublime ideas.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

    <p>Anybody who has looked into the abyss of his or her consciousness knows that the
abyss looks back at you, as Nietzche said. The unconscious mind is a very live and
active zoo of escaped animals raging about in pure chaos and savagery. Does
their years of pent-up frustration make them even more crazy when they finally
escape? And in all of this unintelligible impulse speaks back from the chasm some
kind of insidious intelligence. In modern psychology, this hidden intentionality has
been called the id, the shadow, or the unconscious.</p>

    <p>Early in the kundalini awakening when I was still a student in the university, I had many experiences that shook my world apart.  There was a period where I had many strange visions that didn’t make sense to me until years later.  During meditation I would feel that I was merging into the whole city of Austin around me.   My mind would expand outward beyond the city and I would get lost in bliss.  It was terrifying yet exhilarating.  It was the death of the little “I,” In one of these experiences I had a waking dream in which I knew I was seeing myself 5 years in the future.  I was in Austin but on a farm outside the city where I was very happy and at peace.  I thought to myself that it was absurd because I had no plans of remaining in Austin after graduation.  I forgot all about this dream until I found myself at this very same farm 5 years later.  The details of the vision like a telephone line crossing the property by a creek proved exact.  Meanwhile, back in ‘94, the vision continued.  In the next part of the vision I knew it was 10 years into the future now and the scene changed.  I was in Mexico in the middle of a war.  I felt very tense in this part of the vision but the scene changed into a third scene where I was far above Austin, almost in outer space.  I looked down and the world was very different.  The coast line was much more inward.  There were fewer people but there was much more respect between them.  I saw that they understood the lesson that nature gave them.    I didn’t know when in the future this third part of the vision occurred, just that it was sometime after the Mexico part.  I wasn’t even sure if I was alive on the planet, or floating without a body in some ethereal space from where I was observing in the dream.  It didn’t matter because there was finally peace.</p>

    <p>There are still living some very great yogis that so beautifully reflect the influence of the grace that Anandamurti showered on his closest disciples. A great master like Anandamurti could heal any disease, physical or mental because he could see the subtle causes deep in the mind and also because he had infinite love. Being close to his closest disciples was the greatest blessing of my life and I owe everything to those sincere beings that have sacrificed their lives for the work of dharma. I met some who reflected their guru’s compassion so deeply that they began to take on the negative samskaras or karmic reactions of others so that those struggling could develop in their practices and become strong themselves. It is not that they will this, rather, it is that because of their own spiritual freedom and compassionate realization, the Macrocosmic Mind may express this grace through them. People of this category are the most valuable people in human society. Their sole duty on this planet is to help others and maintain the balance of dharma. Some of them are very ill as they are aging and their physical bodies no longer have the energy to burn off the samskaras of others. Despite the fact that so many of their fellow disciples are falling from the path and have only plagued and bogged them down with their deviant expressions, these noble few are still keeping the mission of dharma alive and vibrant. Without these beacons of hope, the work of Anandamurti would indeed be lost. Everything I have said and done against those whom I believe are only harming their work was of my own planning and doing. My only intention has been to reveal the hypocrites, criminals, and spiritual power-mongers that are causing so much harm to their spiritual society and the legacy of Anandamurti.</p>

    <p>The following is from Discourses on Tantra V.II by Anandamurti. The garland of skulls are the 50 mental vortexes that the yogi must pass through on the journey to the infinite. They create the masks of selfishness, vanity, and separation that mother Kali removes; sometimes it is a little frightening. Just like the union of indescribable joy described through samadhi, or union with the divine, it is also a death experience for what was never truly alive inside of us anyways. However, the ego always resists. Mother Kalii comes to clean up the ego’s mess and put us back on the proper path. The “violence” of the experience is but the resistance of our tenacious separateness from our very own eternal bliss. very profound mythology.

    <p>Why do such terrible things happen in this relative world while our deeper understanding knows that dharma protects all? Dharma is the moral order of the universe. It is the hidden force that works to make us whole and give us what we need to expand in this existence so as to find the eternal beatitude. “Those who protect dharma are protected by dharma,” said Anandamurti. Is the reverse true as well, that those who don’t protect dharma aren’t protected by dharma? A reckless life with no discernment only breeds chaos. Actions based on unbridled desires will certainly not have very tame reactions. I would say that even the ignorant that go against dharma are protected too, although they may have to undergo reactions from their ignorant actions to put the universe and themselves back into balance once again. Essentially, dharma holds all beings together within a supreme being.  When we go against this natural order there are reactions and imbalances in the body, mind, and spirit.</p>

    <p>Spiritual vision through the medium of mental forms is truly a form of divine grace. It is a certain
illumination and showering of elevated thought and feeling that is designed by deep Intelligence to
guide us onward and inward. Form helps us eventually understand the formless, the quiet I-Witness
that is always now. Mystical vision is more than mere knowledge. Through it, knowledge is conveyed
but in the most beautiful and meaningful manner. One could never throw such an experience away;
each time it is recalled one gets the original message and merges into silent peace and joy.</p>

    <p>According to our Headkick Headtrick Tantra, the kundalini is the fundamental creative force in the universe and not just a subtle force that functions in the physical microcosmic organism. Anandamurti termed the kundalini the “fundamental negativity.” It is “negative” in that it is the return force that can recover even the most furthest centrifugal force away from the cosmic nucleus. Kundalini, as it functions in the microcosm, doesn’t take one further away from the cosmic nucleus, rather it is the fundamental force that is capable of returning all of our mental creation to its origin. No matter how far our creation has materialized from spirit into matter, and no matter how far we have lost ourselves in illusion, desire, or ignorance, the Mother Shakti as kundalini will take us home.</p>

    <p>Memory is the capacity to recall events that have already happened. A poor
memory is like shifting sand and can’t even remember what truly
happened. It is like a liar that actually begins to believe and narrate lies to
the extent that they are not even remembered as lies. A good memory is
honest and remembers every thought and emotion, whether the most
sublime and divine or the most dark. But what happens when we try to
recall events where all thought disappear, these moments of illumination
when there is no doubt, no fear, no argument and you are as you truly are?
When I sat next to Chandranath and tried to listen to him speak of the
Supreme Consciousness I could not understand a word he said. He took me
into himself and there was only silence and a soft. white glow. I still try to
recall that experience and become so still, forget even breathing, and there
is still only silence and a soft, white glow.
The divine faculty of memory is so often hijacked by the ego and exploited
to its end. When sad, all of the memories of one life become sad. When</p>

    <p>Both the kśatriyas and the vipras like to enjoy material wealth, though their methods of accumulating material objects are different. The vaeshyas, however, are more interested in possessing material objects than enjoying them. Looking at their possessions, or thinking about them, gives them a certain peace of mind. So in the Vaeshya Age the practical value of material goods is less than at any other time. They gradually become inert both literally and in financial terms. This is the greatest curse of the Vaeshya Age, because the less the mobility of material goods, that is, the greater their stagnation in different spheres, the more harmful it is for the common people. In the Kśatriya and Vipra Ages it is very rare for people to die of starvation while grains rot in the warehouses. Although there is disparity of wealth in the Kśatriya and Vipra Ages, kśatriyas and vipras do not kick others into a pit of privation, poverty and starvation while they themselves enjoy their wealth. This is because they see other people as tools to be used for the purpose of exploitation, but do not see them as the wellspring of exploitation as the vaeshyas do. To a vaeshya, the shúdras, kśatriyas and vipras are not only tools to be used for exploitative purposes, they are the wellspring of exploitation as well.&lt;/p&gt;

<p class="Para_Indent">Unity among the members of any society or social structure is absolutely necessary, otherwise the structure will start disintegrating. Lack of unity among the members of society because of too much self-interest in the individual members, the formation of groups for economic or social advantage, and the lack of understanding of others’ acts not only bring about the downfall of society but also completely eradicate it from the face of the earth.

    <p>Different groups of people contribute to the building of society in different ways. This diversity carries a special significance for the social structure as a whole. If diversity had not existed, human society would not have advanced even as far as the Stone Age, let alone the present stage of civilization. So we have to impartially consider and support all the diverse ideas, forms and colours which are conducive to fostering personal growth and social development among human beings. If we fail to do so, that section of society which has been built around a particular idea, form or colour will wither and die. I direct this not only to those who think deeply about social welfare, but to all members of society, to impress upon them that no one, through their thoughts, words or actions, should ever condone injustice.&lt;/p&gt;

    <p>To sadvipras [spiritual revolutionaries] the value of human life surpasses all other values. So states and scriptures, societies and religions, acquire significance only insofar as they develop humanity to the maximum through learning, culture, physical health and economic plenty. It is for the sake of developing humanity that civilization has so many institutions of different kinds, that states take their various forms, that theories proliferate, and that the scriptures abound in ordinances and regulations. What in the world does the state stand for, what is the use of all these regulations, and what are the marvels of civilization for, if people are prevented from manifesting themselves, if they do not get the opportunity to build good physiques, to invigorate their intelligence with knowledge, or to broaden their hearts with love and compassion? If, instead of tending to lead human beings to the goal of life, the state stands in the way, it cannot command loyalty, because humanity is superior to the state. According to Rabindranath Tagore, “Justice and law at the cost of humanity is like a stone instead of bread. Maybe that stone is rare and valuable, but it cannot remove hunger.”</p>

    <p>The intellect of intelligent people can penetrate where the rays of the sun cannot. Such people want to enjoy matter without being subservient to it. In other words, they want to control matter with their mental waves. It is not only kśatriyas who do this, but vipras as well. The fundamental difference between kśatriya-hood and vipra-hood is that the ego of the kśatriyas draws objects of enjoyment to itself through a physical struggle with all opposing forces, while the ego of the vipras or their desire for enjoyment draws matter to itself either by the physical force of others through physical clash, or directly through psychic clash but avoiding physical clash, or through physical or psychic clash or both according to the demands of the situation.</p>

<p class="Para_Indent">The existence of the relative factors of time, space and person is substantiated in the field of cognition, and the cognizant bearing in its inertness is the highest stance of these factors. The inherent dynamicity of an entity, depending on the existential collaboration of another entity (or in certain cases of other entities, in which case immobility becomes of indefinite character), is called its gati [movement], while that of an entity independent of other entities is called its agati [immobility]. When this relative movement loses its adjustment with the temporal factor it may be called a state of pause – in a limited sense, staticity. The movement of an entity in relation to the witnessing faculty may be called its accelerated or retarded movement, depending upon the degree of its actional expression.</p>

    <p>Prana, the subtle energy that functions between the mental chitta and the physical nerve cells, gets suspended during nirvikalpa samadhi. The breath stops, the heart almost stops and the mind ceases to function without the pulsation of prana that always flows with the breath. During this phase before blissful oblivion one can tactually feel a warm glow around the pineal area in the brain vibrating Om at the tone of C-sharp. The blissful feeling also descends into the anahata like a cool balm. All is sweet, one sees the immortal Self as it always has been. Memories of your past become memories that the Self had while diving down into your every unforgettable memory. The infinite being has always lived your life and sees your every memory from the eternal now of the I-Witness. It fully loves and accepts and absorbs you because you are It now. Then one forgets everything and realizes that one has not breathed nor been conscious of the body nor the outside world for perhaps several hours. I have known cases of yogis who suspended their breath in samadhi for 10 hours. This is experiential proof of nirvikalpa samadhi and of immortality the Self who is verily the great Brahma. In this experience first there is Om, the bliss, the the opening of Hunab Ku, and then the silence and breathlessness in union with the mystery of mysteries. In perfect equilibrium, the entire entity of mind and thus the entire phenomenological identity is suspended in the Shiva-Shakti godhead.</p>

    <p>Now I have got your attention! When speaking about the second, or svadhistana chakra, most people immediately think of sexuality. The six vrttis or vortexes of the svadhistana chakra are indifference, depression, compulsion, lack of confidence, paranoia, and resentment. These 6 tendencies have more to do with a lack of sound grounding in one’s person rather than sexuality. The sexual drive is rooted in the sensory mind, in the first chakra. The problem is that due to a lack of awareness of one’s emotional and physical needs, the sexual desire often gets confounded with these defense mechanisms.</p>

    <p>Metaphysics and psychology are unified in Tantra. Ultimately, the
deepest studies of our inner nature merge with absolute reality beyond our
relative mental, psychological projections about reality. The still, quiet, and
introspective mind can be focused and tuned in to the greater universe.
One learns to live in harmony with an inner peace and wisdom that
connects the personal, microcosmic being with an inward, hidden order in
the Macrocosm, the universe. The Tantric theories about creation, involution, and evolution
are very deep and complex. I refer the serious metaphysical reader to Idea
and Ideology of Anandamurti or the works of Sir John Woodruff for a more
complete description of Tantric cosmology and metaphysics. This book is
more focused on psychology and phenomenology than metaphysics.
Central to Tantric cosmology are the concepts of Shiva and Shakti.
Shiva is infinite consciousness and Shakti is divine, creative energy. Shiva
is the transcendent First Father of our Consciousness and Shakti is the
Great Mother Creator. They are inseparable in essence, like fire and its
capacity to burn. Together they are Brahma, the Supreme Consciousness,
or godhead, to use a concept from Western mysticism.</p>

    <p>The time in which we live today is certainly the most crucial time in the planet’s history. There has certainly been great evil and distortion of dharma in the history of this planet. But never has it been so universal; effecting all of the planet and its inhabitants- plants, animals, and humans. Modern materialism has afforded human beings the dominion of nature and the enslavement of humanity. A global material culture has been created that makes it difficult to see the Spirit in things. The majority of human beings are wrapped up in their physical existence. The “privileged” are involved in pursuing their material comforts. The majority, on the other hand, are struggling to eat and obtain basic commodities. Where are the humans that still have a little humanity? Recall the Sanskrit word for human being, manusa- mind-preponderant being. I don’t mean to say that the majority of humanity is completely bad, rather that the majority are so distracted and have very little dharmic alternatives for existence. On the other hand, I don’t want the term “distracted” to lighten the gravity of the situation. When the mind moves toward matter it degenerates slowly but surely. With the majority of human beings thinking, feeling, and acting mainly in the material world there is a definite trend of degeneration. Instead of the mind moving in the flow of evolution, or pratisaincara. there is a negative evolution, or negative pratisaincara.</p>

    <p>The cultivation of positive mentities is a topic very much related to proper biopsychological functioning. The human nervous, endocrine and glandular systems are the physical, corporeal vehicles for the subtle mind. They must all be in optimal health for the mind to be able to resonate with positive mentities and their corresponding mental layers and propensities. Any changes in the mental structure are reflected in the body and vice-versa. For proper psycho-physical parallelism the body must support the mind and the mind must support the body.</p>

    <p>Both positive and negative mentities are entities that function at the mental level but also provoke changes in the biopsychology of organisms. If we review the kosas and understand how grosser levels of mind are products of subtler ones, and that the physical body (mention annamaya kosa!!! Also the sounds of the vrttis) is the grossest level of mind then we can understand a little clearer the complex phenomenon of biopsychology. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</p>

    <p>Tantra is a Sanskrit word derived from “tan” which means “darkness” or “inertia” and “tra” which signifies “expansion.” Hence, “tantra” means expansion from a state of spiritual darkness, inertia, or ignorance that binds us to the limited material world with its relative joys and sufferings. Tantra is an ancient science of meditation and concentration to awaken the mind from an instinctual animal slumber. It is a practice to further physical, mental, and spiritual evolution so that the human being may more fully understand his/her place in the universe. This systematic and practical discipline follows the natural course of evolution and guides the mind from instinct to intellect to intuition. As Anandamurti explained, it is a method to convert physical energy into psychic energy and then convert that accumulated psychic or mental energy into pure, spiritual cognition.
Tantra, in its proper and essential form, is “mystical empiricism” in that the practitioner can follow certain systematic disciplines and verify in one’s own mental laboratory whether the system is true or not. If one expands from the inertia of blind instinct and intellectual ignorance and attains a degree of insight, peace, and clarity in the existential and spiritual domains, then the scientific practice of tantra is effective and therefore true in that the practice leads one to the objective of spiritual illumination.</p>

    <p>The so-called “positive mentities” are entities that aid human beings with their psycho-spiritual development. Just as there are these entities that help us by promoting our positive tendencies, there are also entities that promote, provoke and exacerbate our baser tendencies. A working, practical definition of negative microvita would be the entities that function through the vrttis of the manipura and lower vortexs. The positive mentities affect the vrttis of the anahata and higher vortexs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
 All mentities function through the medium of the vrttis. The negative mentities function in the same manner as the positive in that they too act as mental faculties for microcosms. They too are not entities separate from the microcosm. They are the causal forces that control the negative vrttis. Whereas the positive mentities act as a guiding function furthering psycho-spiritual evolution, the negative pirate the mind, directing it toward baseness. All mentities act as superpersonal forces that dictate the personal expressions of an individual mind.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</p>

    <p>Anandamurti spoke of Microvita in several different aspects. He described the grossest forms of Microvita involved in the materialization and manipulation of material forces as well as the most subtle forms of microvita that function on the psycho-spiritual planes of being. The focus of this work will principally be on the function of microvita in the psycho-physical, psychic and psycho-spiritual planes of mind. Because microvita is such a broad, generalized term that includes so many types of disembodied microcosmic minds, I will refer to the entities hitherto discussed that relate to human psycho-physicaI, psychic, and psycho-spiritual planes of mind as <i>mentities</i>, or mental entities. I admit that my knowledge of these subtle entities on these levels is still elementary, but I have yet to investigate the function of microvita on the physical level, therefore I am even less capable of attempting to discuss them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</p>

    <p>Any sincere spiritual seeker is satisfied with nothing less than the Infinite itself. Our quest for knowledge is infinite. When we discover a secret or hidden cause, we discover a chain of other questions that lead to yet undiscovered causes. And the further our knowledge ascends toward the spiritual, the summit of all knowledge, the more subtle and finer are the causes and the levels of mind to perceive them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>We can begin to understand the reasons for the limitations the egocentric “I” notion that distorts the pure reflection of Hunab Ku in the human mind by examining the spiritual heart.  Within the spiritual heart or Anahata Vortex exist the roots of our divided and fragmented modern consciousness but also the qualities of compassion, understanding and unity with the true “I” within.  Pluma Blanca explained that all of the expressions of the so-called “vortexs” are balanced by the spiritual heart, what yogis call the Anahata Chakra.  I prefer to use “vortex” instead of “chakra.”  The traditional concept of the Anahata Vortex is a lotus with 12 petals.  Each “petal” is a vortex spiraling out of the greater vortex or “lotus,” like many small tornadoes that group together to form one giant vortex.  These petals or minor vortexes are known as vrttis- vortexes of mental energy.  These vrttis vibrate the entire mind and body and qualify them so as to express particular states of thought and emotion.  Vrttis are the fundamental intelligence behind our thoughts and feelings, the hidden programming of human cognitive and emotional life.  The Anahata Vortex is subtle like the higher vortexs with their finer, cognitive tendencies, but at the same time has grosser qualities like the lower vortexs that express more instintual and egocentric tendencies.</p>

<p>In the Anahata there appear to be two hexagons. Really, there is one. They seem different because one moves clockwise or centrifugally, and the other moves counter-clockwise or centripetally. Here we can see the fundamental yin-yang or centrifugal-centripetal interplay of the universe at work within the human mind.  These are 12 points at which the balances and imbalances of the human consciousness may express themselves in a refined way. When there is perfect balance and there is no escape through any vortex or vrtti in the 12 vertices, Hunab Ku always enters the human mind through the spiritual heart with its neutral force of consciousness or citishakti.</p>

<p>The right side of this plexus is solar or centrifugal. The left side of this plexus is lunar or centripetal. The centrifugal force under the control of the witnessing entity of Shiva becomes the Son, the primordial creative expression of the Supreme Consciousness within the human and personal medium. It is for this reason that the Vedantic sages meditated on the right side of the spiritual heart, the nexus of where the super-personal Atman “touches” the personal and human. </p>

<p>The left side is the Mother of God, the centripetal shakti that always brings the expressions of the Son back to the neutral force of consciousness. The centripetal force never lets the centrifugal force become entirely lost into manifold expression and always brings it back to center.  Together, in balance, these binary forces of creation manifest in the human being to the grade that there is a balance in the 12 vortices or vrttis at the 12 vertices of the 2 hexagons. When there is less duplicity, arrogance, vanity, and selfishness(negative vrttis), and more love, discernment and faith (positive vrttis), then the process of the unification of the microcosmic consciousness into the Macrocosmic Consciousness of Shiva is well under way. It is here in the spiritual heart of Anahata that the nameless godhead may evolve a name for itself, for us, within each of us.</p>

    <p>Everything in this universe is in constant change.  The Vedas call the universe <i>jagat</i>, that which is in constant movement.  As the whole universe is in movement, nothing ever remains the same.  Perfection is a transcendent ideal not to be found in the physical, changing universe. Euclidean forms only exist in the realm of imagination, and not in the physical world.  Einstein has even shown that the path of a photon is not direct as its trajectory curves away from large, gravitational bodies like a star.  All things in this Macrocosm interact by pushing  and pulling on each other.</p>

<p>Parts one and two gave a theoretical outline of the functioning of the human mind and its evolutionary status in relation to the cosmos.  Its general structure, laws and dynamics were discussed in a theoretical manner.  This section will deal with the practical approach to understanding the spiritual evolution of mind and personality.  Rather than further explaining the theoretical structure of mind, this section will focus on the spiritual disciplines that facilitate the development of mind.  In fact, Tantric meditation, as Anandamurti has stated, is 99% practice and 1% theory.  The study of theoretical metaphysics and psychology in Tantra is but a preparation for the intuitive practice of Tantra.  However, when seen as a preparatory tool to foster intuitive practice, theoretical study in fact becomes a practical exercise for the development of mind rather than mere abstract musing.  The purpose of the pursuit of knowledge is to directly experience spiritual realities, rather than merely philosophizing about them.  Tantra is therefore a “mystical empiricism”.
Rajadhiraja Yoga is traditional 8-fold yoga with Tantric techniques.  Tantra Maya is Rajadhiraja Yoga with Tantra Maya techniques.  The classic 8-Fold Yoga, or Astaunga Yoga, are 8 steps in the practice of sadhana.  They gradually direct the physical energy of the body into the intelligence of the mind.  This mental dynamism is further transformed into spiritual cognition, or refined spiritual awareness.  The lower of the 8 steps deal more with the lower kosas while the higher steps work with the higher kosas.  </p>

    <p>At humanity’s present stage of evolution, it is very rare to find
individuals, much less societies, functioning at the level of the Vishuddha
Vortex. In fact, it is rare to find individuals that have assimilated the
tendencies of the Anahata Vortex. However, there are concepts for such
states of mind for these individuals such as “self-actualizing” or “well-
adjusted” people. Although human society is still far from fully integrating
the Anahata propensities, there are a few individuals within that society
who have made this leap.</p>

    <p>Up until the Anahata Vortex the human being is but a “raging bundle of desire in a dying animal,” to use the words of Yeats.  It was said previously that the Manipura Vortex gives one an intimation of the infinite with its infinite desire for expansion, but falls short of the pure conception by projecting infinite desire on finite objects.  The Manipura at the navel is still governed by ontological hunger with its accompanying cravings, demands, and impositions on the objective world.  It can ask “how?” and then proceed to manipulate and maneuver the external world according to its internal desires, but it lacks the self-reflective conscience to ask “why?” or “what for?” in a deeply moral sense.  The Manipura Vortex is balanced only when it is under the guidance of the more conscious and moral Anahata.  It should be very clear to the reader that much of the present day ills in our materialistic and capitalistic pseudo-culture are due to the over activation and exploitation of the Manipura Vortex.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

    <p>The Svadhistana Vortex’s main function is to secure the emerging sense of identity from the womb of unconsciousness and blind instinct, which characterize the pre-conscious and pre-human mind at the Muladhara, Sensory Mind. Once a secure base for the personality is established in a balanced Svadhistana Vortex, the personality can begin to expand and encounter new qualities and experiences. Here we see the continued expansion of artha vrtti and the effort to expand the Conceptual Mind so as to acquire a greater degree of meaningful psychological development. The higher expressions of artha are unable to express themselves completely in the Svadhistana due to the primary activity of maintaining and securing the psychological grounding of the identity. Once there is a stable emotional foundation the personality can flourish and expand.</p>

    <p>Within the human genome is a record of all previous forms of life; from human to hominid to Gila monster.  All of ancestral life is within our little microcosmic existence, and recorded in our DNA. After so many life experiences as microbes, plant, reptile, and mammal the microcosmic mind eventually becomes conscious of itself.  Just as there is now a more developed cerebral cortex built upon the reptilian and mid-brains, the Aham-intelligence begins to evolve and replace the blind instincts of the Sensory Mind and chitta.   There are now thoughts and feelings and other qualities of internal, subjective mental awareness that begin to influence the biological organism.  Human consciousness is clearly, sensibly conscious and self-reflective as the subjective chamber of mind begins to have influence over the objective chamber.
The human being occupies a unique though quite odd place in the spectrum of microcosmic evolution.  Plotinus said that humans exist somewhere between the level of the gods and the beasts.  No longer is the modern human being existing in an unconscious Eden, devoid of self consciousness, driven only by instinct, and completely fused with Nature, Shakti’s creation.  Nor are we completely unified in the transcendental Shiva Consciousness, utilizing the full extent of our intellectual-intuitive capacity and liberated from instinct and blind attachments.  Rather, we are an odd admixture and alloy of animal and god, of instinct and reason.  Our evolution is incomplete;  our spiritual resplendence is only beginning to dawn from unconscious obscurity.</p>

    <p>The fundamental urge behind all beings is the endeavor to expand towards the Infinite.  From the rudimentary amoeba to the complex emotional and intellectual human being is this movement and expansion from its current evolutionary status toward greater, yet unrealized potential.  The infinite Consciousness itself has “assumed the guise of finitude” through so many and various expressions that consciously or unconsciously seek re-union with their essential nature.  This evolutionary march is only partially, and at its crudest levels, a struggle for self-preservation with its constant struggle for physical existence.  Behind all of the effort and struggle is the eternal play of the Infinite seeking to regain its pure state of  eternal repose in the Shiva-Shakti godhead.  Biological evolution is the mark of this divine effort, while sadhana is the final impetus to complete this cosmic flow.</p>

    <p>I was initiated into Tantra Yoga in 1993. I was taught in the very pure and secretive Rajadhiraja Tantra Yoga tradition by a very adept Indian yogi, Shambushivananda, a disciple of Anandamurti.  Within a few months the kundalini began with what would be a very long and intense awakening. As a student of psychology and world literature, I had heard of kundalini and other mystical energies but I had never thought they were real, live forces.  I thought it was just interesting archaic symbolism, and not an actual force within the human body that rises up through the spinal column to awaken higher states of awareness.  The universal symbol for this force is the serpent. It is said to be a covert, spiritual force beneath the surface of conscious awareness, like a coiled snake. Kundalini is the fundamental intelligence behind life and evolution, waiting to be awakened when the mind finally desires liberation from finite mental bondages. As this divine “serpent power” rises through the spinal column, one experiences states of deep spiritual realization. For the yogi, kundalini is the force that unites the human with the divine.
One day after classes and a short meditation, at which I was merely a beginner, I laid down on my back due to exhaustion. I felt a soothing force begin to rise up my spine. As this point of white, soft energy rose up into the thoracic region of the spine, I began to hear the sacred Om sound.  It became frightening because there was only Om and nothing else. I opened my eyes but could not see anything. My faculties of sight and hearing were unified and there only existed Om. I knew I was being dissolved in a force that was vibrating within every particle of the universe. It was ecstatic and exhilarating but terrifying. I felt my whole identity would disappear and never return. The kundalini was entering the medulla. I began to repeat my mantra for meditation but it only made the experience more intense. Instead, I began to repeat my name, William Ernest Enckhausen III over and over and trying to remember that I was a student in Austin, Texas on the physical plane of reality. The kundalini began to go back down as Om diminished. I couldn’t take any more.</p>
