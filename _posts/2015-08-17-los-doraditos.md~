I try my best to write about mystical subjects. However, words just don't do it. I was once very ill after being around too many patients. A golden light passed through me and healed me. It is like it just passed through me from the adobe wall behind me. It was a certain type of microvita. Some of the old people around here know about these benevolent entities. They call them the "doraditos" or "golden beings." It inspired me to write a song. I only played it on the flute until my friends joined in with the lyrics, guitar and yukilele.

We belong to the golden race
We come down to share grace
Seeing all beings
Whatever tone or hue
Bringing Light of Truth
Taking every mind
Back to You
Only to You

Baba Nam Kevalam.......

One can't hold onto your world
World escapes free,
Through one's every word.
Just hear our verse
Through your universe
And turn our golden light
Into purest white
As we go
Only to You
Back to You
Only to You
