    &lt;p&gt;“Brahma alone is the guru.” This saying from the Upanishad represents a very universal conception of the deity. Brahma literally means that which is great and makes others great. In other words, Brahma is the Consciousness of the Macrocosm, of the entire universe. The guru is none other than the Supreme Consciousness and cannot be tainted by partiality nor prejudices nor any relative projection of a messiah or human guru. What is, simply is. &lt;!--more--&gt;If the Supreme Consciousness can create this entire universe, then surely there is an unmediated, direct way to communicate with me, a little microcosm in this Macrocosm. “Am I a secluded figure, in the vast, a little ameagre? No no no no I am not alone, the great is with me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And one could imagine that such a Macrocosmic deity is not a petty god of a certain country or class or society of exclusive human beings that deserve his mercy. The tiny little human microcosmic mind with its prejudices and attachments finally understands that “god” is not to be found through any finite form, material nor mental. The sacred books and messiahs and Buddhas were just approximations of a an inner, mystical truth. Only those who dare question the root of their being free of these appendages could possibly find the root of their being free of all relative conditioning. Non-dualism, or Advaita, is the idea that ultimately the consciousness of the individual microcosm and the Macrocosm are fundamentally the same. This is not to say that my consciousness has become the consciousness of the universe, that the ego becomes god. Rather, my consciousness has been taken into, accepted, transformed, digested, and finally assimilated into the living, working consciousness of the Macrocosm or Brahma. The microcosm is no longer a separate entity creating negative reactions and contaminating the world while fleeing from one empty dream to the next. The illumined microcosm is a mental cell unified with other mental cells that form a Macrocosm, a collective body of minds. Here, one can’t bring attachments, prejudices, nor any other petty ego control issue. The moment they arise, the Macrocosm knocks you off of your feet. It takes much time and evolution and trial and error to find a flow of unity into the Macrocosm. One must unlearn the socially-conditioned and indoctrinated ego along with all of its hereditary mental and biological instincts in order to learn the ways of Brahma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only those born with developed intuitive faculties can understand these truths without following teachers or paths. Life just somehow teaches these inner lessons. I suspect that these minds are “primed” with this knowledge from birth and that it was probably learned earlier. Plato saw all knowledge as something that has already been learned. What we experience here in the finite world are recollections of truths already known. Genius, according to this view, is nothing more than having at one’s disposal what has already been learned. Spiritual orientation is innately developed in some just as art or music or mathematics is innately developed in others.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;es-ES&quot;&gt;The idea of a human guru or a spiritual teacher is to help one understand these fundamental cardinal truths of non-dualism. A guru is one who has walked that path and is capable of showing it to others. However, most of the time, a concept of guru is but an opiate for a desperate personality separated from the life of the universe due to its ignorance and egoism. Belief is mostly desperate compulsion and the idea of a guru is often a 2-edged sword. Normally, when people speak to you about gurus they want to sell you on some idea. They often want others to bandy together with them under some omnipotent messiah, guru, and their religion or institution. They don&#39;t really want to have their own experiences but prefer just to adopt the ideas and traditions of others to find security and refuge. The more absolute the idea, the more effective is the opiate and the more placated is the compulsion of the fearful and separate little ego to grasp on to some form of meaning

If one works through these limited ideas of a guru, then perhaps one can really understand something of another human being that is wise and compassionate and only has your well-being in mind.

I came to believe that Anandamurti was a true guru. I never met him in physical form. I was convinced of his special character because of his disciples. These exceptional human beings considered Anandamurti as their guru and that naturally gives one a certain reverence toward their teacher. There was once a Sufi teacher who knew of Anandamurti and respected him greatly. He sent one of his disciples to see him. The disciple went to see him but only saw an absurd show of dogmatic followers running about in an absurd guru-devotee show. The master rebuked him and told him he was only judging external appearances. What he should have seen is that the master (Anandamurti) was so great that he accepted all people, even clowns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;es-ES&quot;&gt;Fortunately, I made it past the show of spiritual salesmen and was able to meet some of the more mature disciples of Anandamurti, both monastic and lay. In general, the community of Ananda Marga was very respectable. There were people from all strata of society working and moving together under the inspiration of Anandamurti. The problems mostly resided with the monastic institution after the death of Anandamurti. The more mature meditators didn&#39;t have any doubts about the divinity of their teacher but were never dogmatic about it nor tried to impose it on others. They put their meaning in doing practical work and sincere spiritual practice. Near these mature disciples one could feel a certain lightness and expansion of mind that helps one to realize that the guru is deep within, inside of one&#39;s deepest sense of peace. This influence made meditation much clearer and peaceful. It seemed impossible to cling to any form of teacher when one feels at one with the living Macrocosm of Brahma. I began to see an inner light that radiated into every form that entered my mind. I saw the same spirit both within and without. I became certain that I was not my body nor my mind and so how was it possible to cling to some human guru form? However, none of these elder teachers ever tried to impose this form upon me and the stories that I well tell of them will hopefully help other people appreciate the philosophy and spiritual practices of Anandamurti.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;es-ES&quot;&gt;When I first arrived at Ananda Nagar I met a yogi who told me some very useful secrets. He immediately took me into his confidence. He looked at me intensely and I felt like I was being scanned. The first thing he told me was a tip of how to transmute sexual energies. I had never heard a monk talk about things so openly, yet with such intelligence and purity. Far from being perverse or hypocritical fantasies of a celibate monk, it was the most practical insight into desire that I had heard of in my life. As a young single man I greatly appreciated his insights. The second important thing he told me is that some day Ananda Marga will probably end up killing their own saints. He laughed heartily but he was serious. It was inconceivable to me at the time. Furthermore, it seemed like heresy because everybody else was only talking how great Ananda Marga was and how Anandmurti left all of his power and grace in this organization! Now, 20 years later, I see what he meant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;es-ES&quot;&gt;Later, on another visit, he told me how yogis can leave their bodies and travel through the inner dimensions of time and space. He said it was another reality in which there exist not these relative factors of time and space. It was a Dreamland that was even more real than physical reality, a kind of astral repository of all human experience and memory-past, present and future. He said that you could know whatever you needed to know and meet whoever you needed to meet on this plane of reality. I was eager to visit this Hall of the Immortals. He told me how to leave my body and at what time of night I could do it. I left the conversation with a desire to see if I could somehow know something of the teacher of these great men that I was meeting and was inspired by. Later that night I followed the prescribed technique. Nothing happened at that moment. Later I slept and then it started to work. I awoke completely with a holy jolt of spiritual lightning in my spine. I could feel the kundalini rising. I could feel it swishing through the cerebral spinal fluid that was concentrating inside the brain. When it entered inside the head there was only light and sound, every color was within white and every sound within Om. All through the night there was a whirling vortex of energy moving around the crown of my head. It had no form, just sound and color. I was entirely awake but the more the kundalini rose the more I entered into a very conscious state of trance. It was more real than anything I had ever experienced. Rather than a world with forms and mass, all was very fine and soothing vibration. I understood how the crown chakra and the pineal gland were the microcosmic receptor and channel to enter into the formless, infinite Macrocosm. Everything made sense as pure idea. There was no fear or uncertainty of this unknown reality. All was bliss and I felt quite free and pure. I realized that my body was lying on my bed in a trance but that my consciousness was very clearly in the Present without names and forms. Every once in a while I would see the form of Anandamurti and the whole vibrational scene would turn into something more like a dream, only much more real and lucid. I thought “this is a dream”, but I knew it was a very special sort of dream. I still to this day recall it just as clear as a “waking” state of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;es-ES&quot;&gt;To this day I am still trying to realize the significance of these detailed conversations with the guru apparition. Perhaps it wasn&#39;t absolutely necessary for him to appear as a human to another human in a state of lucid dream, but it was a very personal and affective touch from something or someone very sublime. As the years pass by these revelations become even clearer and life makes more sense. There was only so much I could understand as a little spiritual fledgling in my early twenties. They were experiences that by their very nature need a full life-time to be realized. Although I have never preached or tried to convince others about the divinity of Anandamurti, I have never ever doubted this influence in my life. For so many years I didn&#39;t even speak of him. It was a subtle struggle of reconciling form with formlessness, and the idea that the guru archetype may actually appear with a human form. I always considered the latter as a relative possibility and never wanted my experiences to be some kind of “proof” for the ego to make fixed ideas about the infinite. This is a subtle error that causes great damage to an otherwise pure ideology, whether it is one&#39;s personal set of ideas or the ideology of a spiritual society. If mystery, subtlety, and free speculationare substituted by concreteness and conformity, then only dogma will remain. Human beings armed with exclusive ideas always end up creating trouble for themselves and others. I always try to refer to Anandamurti&#39;s philosophical ideas that the Supreme Consciousness is infinite and formless. With those who tried to impose the absolute form of the guru, I only saw religion in the making and soon learned that there was no sense arguing these matters. Over the years I have taught formless meditation with an entirely different system to others without referring to Anandamurti yet many of my students continue to have similar profound experiences and dreams of Anandamurti. It is something that only continues to grow silently inside of me and others. He himself only said that he was, is, and will remain a mystery. However, the philosophy he left is very clear, rational and lucid. I hope others find something special in his works that I am sharing. They were compiled as books, but all of them are based on talks that he gave over several decades to thousands of people.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“O yogi, sit in lotus under the sacred neem and together make impenetrable conscious force with nature. The death troopers will receive a great blessing from your practice. Infinite, white burning light penetrates and ignites their darkness. An immediate reaction shakes their world. Those who dealt so much terror may die in terror of Mother Kali, protector of the planet and of yogis. The next embryo they inhabit will finish its recapitulation with gills and fins. There they will “swim in idle waters and drink other fishes piss.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not many people understood the context of these phrases when I published them with this photo last year. It was a very dark time and I remembered a very dark punk rock song from my youth about reincarnation and how Oedipus complex-ridden perverts are reborn as fish. I never thought anything useful would come out of those memories but I realized that they were quite insightful! The narco death soldiers had just returned to the valley. They had come and gone several times in the last few years. Their soldiers get killed off regularly and there were always new ones ready to come and inhabit their nearby camp. There they keep hostages and then kill them and throw their bodies in the mountains.  I welcomed them back with a solo of Gluck’s “Dance of the Blessed Spirits” on my kena bamboo flute. I finished and they returned the message with gunfire. “Okay, now you all want some of my oboe too?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I truly felt protected and I didn’t worry. At first, I saw it as an ideational, meditative stance to create a protective field around our territory so as to keep their evil away. “As you think, so you become,” say the yogis. I won’t even consider it a possibility that they harm us, and so they won’t. However, as I continued to play and further pound them with Gluck and Bach, I realized that I was probably playing requiems for their upcoming departure from the planet. I thought of how those boys were probably forced into the paramilitary part of the cartel and they probably weren’t that different from the rest of the youth in the area. Human beings will do almost anything under forced coercion, at any time and any place. Soldiers hardly ever really know what they fight for. These boys are dying in a war insidiously designed to make Mexicans kill Mexicans while the gringos continue to rob their country blind. The plan is to let the locals do the raping and pillaging while the imperialists purposely take advantage of this situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this realization, I played music for them not so much to scare them but to try to send these poor souls something beautiful. If they really are like the youth in this area, then they probably have suffered many deprivations and have never really felt much human warmth and compassion. There are very few nuclear families and almost all heads of the household are alcoholics. There are almost no opportunities for these outcasts. However, the system has designed a strategy to get rid of them and make money selling arms and drugs in the process.
They had already entered the ranch on a few occasions in the past. They are used to people being afraid of them. However, we decided to reprimand them. They were terrified. They said they heard voices in their heads and wanted to leave. They said they would give us their protection. “No thank you,” was the reply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t recommend this technique unless one is very fearless and has a really strong mantra! When confronting evil forces that could easily destroy one’s physical being, one’s only protection is innocence and purity. There is fear because there are impurities. We don’t yet fully understand that we belong to immortality and so we attach our identity to some notion of worldly temporality. &lt;em&gt;Sadhana&lt;/em&gt; or meditation burns away the impurities and leads one to a natural state of innocence, at one with nature and spirit. “Who’s universe is this anyway, by what right do these narcos, their narco state and puppet governors have to wield this terror upon us?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Circumstances have given me proof time and again that the only true protection in this world is to be at one with dharma, the moral order of the universe. “Those who protect dharma are protected by dharma.” Dharma is not about beliefs or religion but rather getting to the essence of things by deep contemplation and then know how to react to the situation from this pinnacled, illuminated perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If for some reason I can’t concentrate in meditation, then a little spiritual music or kiirtan always helps. Instead of letting the mind be conditioned by terrible information coming from the world of men and their media, one surrenders to dharma, the silent and natural flow of events in the universe. One can truly feel the harmony of nature and spirit and that the force of &lt;em&gt;dharma&lt;/em&gt;, the conscious force of nature whose only purpose is to serve what is pure and innocent. The best meditation is that which is totally surrendered to Brahma; one desires nothing but simply enjoys being at one with Brahma, the supreme entity. Similarly, the best music is that which is played with spiritual devotion. While in meditation or playing music under the neems or the nearby ceiba tree one totally gets lost in spiritual ideation. With music and meditation along with the protection of the neems and ceiba, one can do the necessary work and create a spiritually-protected atmosphere. To always feel that the Supreme Entity is near and dear, is always loving and looking over, dissipates all fear.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In the Tantra that I learned, Raja Di Raja Yoga, the techniques were very effective in awakening the kundalini. I began to enter the breathless state of samadhi very regularly when I was 23 years old. Although very intense, the practices gave the mind and body the maximum amount of transformation biologically, psychologically, and spiritually possible. &lt;!--more--&gt;However, nobody ever effectively taught me how to bring the kundalini back down. For years I was like a machine working at accelerated capacity. Sometimes I would go into trances while driving and my friend would have to grab the wheel. I would sometimes fall down and swoon while in a spiritual mood. My body once leaped 2 feet into the air when the kundalini awakened while I was sitting in the lotus posture. I cannot jump anywhere near that high in lotus if I try with my best effort and even when using my knees to bounce. This constant rising of the kundalini in me effected others as well, mostly for the good, but also negatively as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was immediately rejected from my yoga society after people knew I was having these experiences. I was told on several occasions by several monastics that I wanted those high samadhi states of realization, then I was in the wrong organization. At first I thought this was absurd. I had only done the practices that they had taught me. Samadhi, spiritual trance, is supposed to happen when the kundalini awakens after sincere practice. It would probably have been alright with them if they had these experiences. Many talked about my experiences much more than I ever did within their gossip circles. They finally admitted my experiences were real, but said that I would die before age 40 because of their intensity. Far from being a complement, they also wished more mundane misfortunes on me as well! I felt like I was the lowest creature on the planet for a little while. While receiving divine bliss on the inside, I received so much hatred from without. There was absolutely no possibility of developing an inflated ego out of these experiences because I was constantly negated by the slanderous talk about me. Later, I did realize that I was in the wrong society. I knew I wasn’t perfect but I wasn’t the narcissistic person that they made me out to be. “What Peter says about Paul says more about Peter than it does about Paul,” I realized. I left these practices entirely. The people who taught me them hated me with such intensity that I felt tremendous pain in my head each time I tried to meditate with their system. It was as if they had suspended my access to Spirit through their channels. Fine, that gave me an opportunity to find out what Tantra is really like, independent of dogmatic religious groups. However, I have always held great reverence to the  teachers that I met who really understood their own practices. If I would not have met these few exceptions, then I would consider my time with this society as a prison sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I left the shelter of a spiritual society without knowing how to bring the kundalini back down, or at least to not be so intense and to remember that this process will probably kill me if it doesn’t calm down. My renunciation of this society was a great blessing, afterall. I realized that people liked me again, despite that I had these strange phenomenon occurring within me. I always felt liked and accepted for most of my existence and I feel that this social acceptance gave me the confidence to be okay with myself and begin to explore new territories of inner being. I felt more at home in a hardware store than in a closed-minded spiritual society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My meditation experiences came back with even more intensity and originality. I gradually developed my own system of practice. Throughout these years I never stopped having dreams of Anandamurti in which he always told me very interesting clues. He never gave anything away, but rather just guided me towards the understanding of spiritual practice. I realized that I didn’t even need to meditate anymore but that Anandamurti continued to give me experiences that would deepen my understanding of meditation. It has been a great adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this time, I became friends with Pluma Blanca, a Mayan yogi from Campeche. On our first meetings he shared his insights about the Tree Tantra. He always sat in meditation under the ceiba tree. It reminded me of how Anandamurti said that it is good to meditate under the neem tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One takes the tree as a symbol for meditation while at the same time taking actual shelter under the tree and participating with its shield of electromagnetic&lt;wbr /&gt; energy while meditating.  According to Mayan mystics “nothing evil can happen while under the ceiba.”  The upward force growing out of the earth helps awaken the kundalini while the downward force of converting air into mass and developing deep roots into the earth helps bring the kundalini back down. Mind must fly upward toward the spirit but also must return to the earth, at least for as long as one is on this earth. Just like the Indian Yogis, Pluma Blanca said that a yogi completes his spiritual practice by bringing the kundalini back down, from the crown and back down into the spiritual heart. This gives a base for the mind mid-way along the spinal column. One can be joyfully engaged in existence here while remaining in a subtle state of being while at the same time keep oneself grounded and in the body. Like the great ceiba tree, one extends high into the heavens while also rooting oneself deep into the earth. Unchecked kundalini force will eventually liberate you but it can kill your body if not careful. One gets attached to spiritual bliss and experiences but must know how to balance them out. It is better to save that intensity for when it is really time to leave all work and thereby the physical body, and never before then. Like the Upanishad says, “Desire to live 100 years while working in joyful unity with Brahma.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I feel certain that the solution to the electromagnetic imbalances that are so greatly affecting the collective consciousness of the planet is quite simple and clear: take refuge in a higher ground. This planet maintains a balance with gravitational and electromagnetic forces by which our consciousness, a complex process involving the glandular and nervous system as well as the mind and Consciousness, has evolved and adapted over millions of years. Despite the fact that many people are having some severe problems of maladaptation to these new conditions, there is a great potential to make some huge leaps in personal and collective awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While contemplating the effect of the increase of solar activity and its effect on the earth’s magnetic field I find my mind always returning to the idea that all forces in this manifested universe are but the result of three fundamental forces; the positive, the negative, and the neutral; or the centrifugal, the centripetal and the neutral. There appears to be an extreme bipolar tendency in the collective mind. Almost everybody I know is in some sort of emotional and/or existential crisis. If not crisis, then at least a great challenge that requires tremendous effort to maintain equilibrium and keep moving forward. Nobody I know has it easy these days. These forces are external to our Consciousness, our Atman, but appear to affect us because our minds are incarnated in physical bodies with sensitive organs that are affected by electromagnetic fields. Due to this adjustment there are many subtle imbalances in the nervous and glandular systems that are altering how the mind thinks, feels and perceives reality. However, meditation and spiritual practice have the reverse affect. The Atman as the nucleus of consciousness vibrates the contemplative, meditative mind with eternal peace and clarity and the mind thereby vibrates the nervous system with this much needed balm of soothing alleviation that puts our physical being back into balance.
While the centripetal and centrifugal forces are fighting out their eternal game of clash and cohesion, the neutral force has the capacity to balance them out, take them into the nucleus of awareness and find a higher synthesis. But where is one to find this neutralizing force, this mediator of the centripetal and centrifugal forces that dominate the physical universe? The neutral force, the equalizing force is to be found not in extroversion or introversion, nor action or inaction, attraction nor repulsion, but in deep attention and presence of these plays of the mind. It is the One presence behind each and every microcosmic mind that maintains the balance of the entire Macrocosm. The entire universe has been, is being, and will always be directed by the One who directs all duality. If you want to bring the mind and emotions into balance it is only through awareness of this blissful entity that this play of forces may take refuge in the eternal repose of the Atman. As Anandamurti said, “the force that guides the stars guides you too.” Perhaps we are in a leap, a shift in evolution which is always and extreme and violent act, but I cannot deny that it is all so beautiful, and behind the apparent chaos and imbalance lies a greater, hidden agenda that only the mind devoted to its source and origin can understand.
This energetic situation will only become more intense until we as a species, a collective consciousness, begin to understand this truth and cultivate a planetary culture which fosters this awareness. So many are falling into emotional imbalances and addictions. We go up too high and then we fall too low. We try to fix the lows with a high and are incessantly chasing our tails in a circle. Really, there is only One solution, and I hope that you all may truly be here to presence it and be part of a new, awakening humanity. Take shelter only in the loving, constant witness of the Atman, or the combativeness forces of nature shall rip thy mind apart like a gang of angry pit-bulls.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;From the study of history, it is known that the Rgveda was composed outside India, mainly in Central Asia and Russia. The Yajurveda was written mostly outside India; only a portion was written in India. And the Atharvaveda was composed in Afghanistan and India. Those three Vedas – Rk, Yaju and Atharva – long afterwards, say about 3500 years ago – were edited and divided into different branches by Maharśi Krśńadvaepáyana Vyása. The oldest compositions were named Rgveda, the intermediate portions were called Yajurveda, and the remaining portions were named Atharvaveda. The last-named Veda was named after the great sage, Atharva, the first author of this Veda. And by compiling the musical compositions of the three Vedas, yet another Veda - the Sámaveda, the fourth Veda – was created. Sáma in Sanskrit means “musical composition”. The Sámaveda itself is not a Veda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadáshiva was born at a time when the age of the Rgveda was coming to an end and the Yajurvedic Age was about to begin. The people had not yet invented script. In the days of Shiva, the serious disadvantage was that, although the people were acquainted with the science of phonetics, that is, the intonations of the letters, they did not know how to write the letters. The Bráhmii and Kharośt́hi scripts were invented some time after Shiva. Thus we can generally say that the Vedas and Tantra exercised their mutual influence over each other, through the invention of script, only at the time of the Atharvaveda.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;23..3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;The external form that was given to Tantra by Shiva in His time underwent a slight transformation in subsequent periods. You may raise the question – well, when the goal is the same, when the path is also the same, then why this transformation? The only cause was: there was no written book in those days. All the compositions – both Vedas and Tantras – were handed down orally from one generation to another. As a result, there arose a difference of opinion among the teachers themselves – one teacher or muni [seer] would say one thing, and another muni would say something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;23..4&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Now although letters were invented during the age of the Atharvaveda, the Vedas could not be written down due to one obstacle – a peculiar superstition (better to call it a dogma) that the Vedas should not be written down. Maharśi Atharva’s followers – Aungirá, Aungirasa, Satyaváha, Vae-darbhi, etc., tried for the first time to get the Vedas written down in letters, but they were not courageous enough to do so because it was forbidden. (The very name of Vaedarbhi suggests that he was a resident of Vidarbha, and in India, particularly in the Vidarbha area, the Atharvaveda was partly written. Hence it is not proper to assume that the entire Veda was written outside India.) The Vedas were called shruti [ear] because they had to be mastered only by hearing: letters had not yet been invented. But once the script was invented, what could be the reason for not writing down the Vedas? The problem was the superstition, and the scholars did not dare to defy the superstition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;23..5&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Now the Post-Shiva Tantra that gradually crystallized through the transformation of the original Shiva Tantra had two branches - the Gaod́iiya School and the Káshmiirii School. In East India, that is, Bengal, where the Gaod́iiya School of Tantra was popular, the Vedas had little influence. But in Kashmir, where the Káshmiira branch of Tantra was more dominant, there was the influence of both Tantra and the Vedas. During those days of ascendancy of the Káshmiira branch of Post-Shiva Tantra, the Káshmiira scholars first wrote the Vedas in contemporary Sáradá script; that is, the Vedas were written first in Sáradá script. Later came the age of Buddhism and Jainism; of course Post-Shiva Tantra was running parallel to them. Script had already been invented. The books on Jainism were mostly written in Prákrta, in a Bráhmii script which was a bit transformed; while the books on Buddhism were written in Mágadhii Prákrta, that is, in Páli, in the Bráhmii script of that time. But the Post-Shiva Tantra was written in Sanskrit; of course in Bráhmii script. So this all proves that the invention of scripts removed a great obstacle on the way. At this time there was a mutual exchange of ideas among Jain Tantra, Buddhist Tantra and Post-Shiva Tantra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;23..6&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;When some ideas or schools of thought exist side-by-side for a long period in a certain country, there is bound to be some sort of mutual exchange, and the result of this type of exchange cannot but be beneficial. It is often found that the result is either good or, at the worst, neither good nor bad. For instance, the Puranic concept of the deity Náráyańa and the Islamic concept of Piirabhakti combined together to give rise to a new concept of Satyapiira in Bengal. Its effect was not bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;23..7&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Similarly, those three schools of Tantra – the Jain, the Buddhist, and the Shivottara [Post-Shiva] – began to come to an understanding. All three schools broadly accepted the division of Tantra into sixty-four main branches, considering its various expressions. The only difference that persisted was the external one of differences in terminology: each school retained certain specific terms of its own. But they all generally accepted that human life had sixty-four types of expression, and hence there were sixty-four branches of Tantra. In their internal essence, they were not very far from one another; only certain terms - something external – were used differently by different Tantras. For instance, the Múlá Prajiṋá Shakti [Fundamental Cognitive Principle] was called Jinaratna or Jinaraana in Jain Tantra –&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;23..8&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Sloka&quot;&gt;Bhańai Káhńu jina raan bi kaesá
Káleṋ bob samvohia jaesá.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;23..9&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;plain&quot;&gt;– whereas in Shiva Tantra, rather in Post-Shiva Tantra, the word Shiva was used, and Buddhist Tantra used the various epithets of Buddha. Thus the sixty-four Tantras were running parallel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;23..10&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;For each of these sixty-four Tantras, one particular yoginii-tattva was accepted as the presiding deity (a particular controlling deity of a particular branch of Tantra was called a yoginii). All three Tantras accepted this arrangement. And all three, in order to maintain their popularity, used the name of Shiva – they declared that each Tantric deity was the wife of Shiva. Those of you who have gone to Jabbalpur might have noticed the sixty-four small temples on a hill there dedicated to these sixty-four yoginiis. They are all sixty-four Jain Tantric deities. Similarly, in Buddhist Tantra, particularly in Vajrayánii Buddhist Tantra, sixty-four deities were accepted. Shivottara Tantra followed the same practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;23..11&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Interestingly, you will notice how at this stage a silent synthesis was taking place among the different schools. Some of the Jain deities were recognized by Buddhist Tantra (for instance, the Jain deity Báráhii, with a swine’s face, was transformed into Vajrabáráhii in Vajrayánii Buddhist Tantra). Shivottara Tantra gave similar recognition to deities of other Tantras. Conversely, some of the deities of Shivottara Tantra were recognized and accepted by Jain and Buddhist Tantra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;23..12&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;All this proves that the synthesis of these three systems of Tantra charted a new path. This was all made possible by the invention of script. As long as script was unknown or unused, they maintained their distinct separateness; but with the popular use of script, they began to come closer to each other. For example, Ambiká is an accepted deity of Jain Tantra. But then she also became recognized by Shivottara Tantra – she was supposed to be a wife of Shiva. (But as you know, these deities cannot be the wives of Sadáshiva, who is seven thousand years old, whereas these deities are all of comparatively recent origin – about two thousand years old – arising after the invention of script.) This Ambiká Devii has been accepted in a different manner in Paoráńik Sháktácára [the Puranic Shákta Cult], as the goddess Lakśmii, but actually she is a Jain deity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;23..13&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;In Ráŕh,&lt;a name=&quot;Ref.23.fn1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;file:///home/v/a.m.books/Books/Discourses_on_Tantra_Volume_One.html#23.fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;)&lt;/sup&gt; there is a town named Kalna where there is still a temple dedicated to the goddess Ambiká. Once there was a tremendous influence of Jainism in Ráŕh. The town was named Ambiká-Kalna, after the goddess, and is now called Enbo-Kalna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;23..14&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Another instance: the Buddhist goddess Tárá was accepted in Shivottara Tantra, and still later, in Paoráńik Sháktácára. And her changed form was accepted in Paoráńik Sháktácára as the goddess Sarasvatii. The goddess Kálii of Shivottara Tantra was accepted in Buddhist Tantra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;23..15&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Thus there came an age of synthesis. And following this synthesis, these deities were accepted as gods and goddesses in Paoráńik Shaevácára [the Puranic Shiva Cult] and Paoráńik Sháktácára in somewhat changed form. This form underwent slightly more transformation during the middle of the Pathan Age, whose influence still lingers in a minor form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;23..16&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Now in the process of synthesis among Jain, Buddhist and Shivottara Tantra, there evolved a new concept, the concept of Dashamahávidyá [Ten Mahávidyás], centring around those deities who had general influence in all three systems of Tantra. The idea of Dashamahávidyá arose out of ten Tantric deities, some from Jain Tantra, some from Buddhist Tantra and some from Shivottara Tantra. These deities, in slightly changed form, were accepted in Paoráńik Sháktácára, Vaeśńavácára, Shaevácára and Gáńa-patyácára [the Puranic Shákta Cult, the Viśńu Cult, the Shiva Cult and the Gańapati Cult]. While analysing the history of Dashamahávidyá, it is interesting to see how the concept of each deity evolved – how an idea dawned upon the human mind and gradually expanded in the path of synthesis until finally its basic defects demolished its own fundaments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;23..17&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;These Ten Mahávidyás are Kálii, Tárá, Śod́ashii, Bhuvaneshvarii, Bhaeravii, Chinnamastá, Dhúmávatii, Bagalámukhi, Mátaungii and Kamalá. These deities are present in all three Tantras. Sometimes their biija mantras [acoustic roots] are the same, sometimes different. For your proper understanding, let me give you a brief idea about these ten deities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;23..19&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;The first of these deities is Káliká. She is one of the controlling deities of Shivottara Tantra, but simultaneously she was accepted in Buddhist Vajrayána. I have said a number of times that Shiva was the most influential personality. Therefore an attempt was made to establish some kind of relationship with Him: it was announced that Káliká was Shiva’s spouse. But one should remember that Shiva was born five thousand years before the age of Káliká; so how could Káliká be His wife? Secondly, Káliká – this controlling deity – is depicted as having four hands. No human structure can have four hands. So Káliká Shakti – Kálii – this deity – is not Shiva’s wife. She is a Tantric deity belonging to subsequent ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;23..20&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;The second deity is Tárá. Tárá is one of the Tantric deities of Vajrayána Tantra. I have said previously that the Tárá that was worshipped in India was known as Ugratárá, while the deity that was worshipped in China was called Bhrámarii Tárá – “black as a bumblebee” – and the one who was worshipped in Tibet (Kiḿpuruśavarśa, as it was known previously) was blue-coloured. So this Tárá was later than Buddha, and later yet than Shiva; hence Tárá cannot be accepted as the wife of Shiva either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;23..21&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;There is not even any similarity in name. Shiva did have one wife whose name was Kálii, so she has at least the similarity in name with Kálii, the deity of Post-Shiva Tantra. But this was not the case with Tárá. Tárá is purely a deity of the Buddhist Vajrayána Tantra. But she is accepted as a deity in Post-Shiva Tantra and the Puranic Shákta Cult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;23..22&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Even today, you will come across boys with names such as Tárápada, Táráprasáda, etc., and girls with such names as Tárádevii. This is the history behind these names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;23..23&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Tárá has no relation to Shiva. People wrongly believe that she is the wife of Shiva. I shall say something more about Tárá later, when I discuss Sarasvatii.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;23..24&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Then comes Śod́ashii, the third deity. In this connection, let us say something about biija mantra [acoustic roots]. At the time of Shiva, there was no use of biija mantra in Shiva Tantra. The people loved Shiva so intimately that they did not think it necessary to worship Him with a particular biija mantra. In subsequent periods the use of biija mantra became an accepted practice. In Buddhist Tantra, the acoustic root of Kálii was raḿ: this was also the acoustic root of energy. This biija mantra signifies the application of energy in action. But in Post-Shiva Tantra the biija mantra for the same purpose was changed into riiḿ. (Ra, the acoustic root of energy, plus ii suffix, indicating feminine gender, equals riiḿ.) This denotes that energy is a female entity. And in still later days, when this deity Kálii was accepted in the Puranic Shákta Cult (the present custom of the worship of the goddess Kálii is derived from the Puranic Shákta Cult), the biija mantra (riiḿ) was further changed into klrḿ: Klrḿ Káli-káyae namah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;23..25&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Generally in the Post-Buddha days, during the period of the Puranic Shákta Cult, all the Buddhist, Jain and Post-Shiva Tantric deities were declared to be the wives of Shiva, otherwise the society would not recognize and worship them. But they have different biija mantras. In the Puranic Age, the commonly accepted practice was that the controlling deities derived from Post-Shiva Tantra were designated as “Dakśińá Shakti”, and those derived from Vajráyána Buddhism were designated as “Vámá Shakti”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;23..26&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;For instance, Káliká: she was known as “Vámá Kálii” when worshipped in Buddhist Tantra. When an image was made of her, she would be painted jet-black; her left leg would be placed forward, her right leg behind; and there would be red patches on her left leg. This deity, Vámá Kálii, was not worshipped inside houses or in villages; she was worshipped in the cremation grounds outside the villages. These days, these deities are called by various names: for instance, Vámá Kálii, Shmashána Kálii, Rakśá Kálii and Rat́antii Kálii. These are all deities of the Buddhist Tantra Cult, subsequently declared to be “Vámá Shakti”; and the goddesses of Post-Shiva Tantra who are now accepted in the Puranic Cult are called “Dakśińá Shakti”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;23..27&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;But the images of Dakśińá Shakti are painted black or blue, or light green, and the right leg is placed in front. They are worshipped mainly at home, or inside the villages. The idea is: we may accept the deities of Buddhist Tantra, but not as family deities or village deities. Some sort of distance must be maintained. But in the case of the Dakśińá Shaktis, there is no such distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;23..28&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Though both types of deity, dakśińá and vámá, were declared to be the wives of Shiva, historically speaking, they had no relationship with Shiva, because all these deities originated at least five thousand years later than Shiva. Not only that, no human structure can have four hands. They have been selected out of the sixty-four schools of Tantra. Basically, they are not human structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;23..29&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;An old Bengali poem says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;23..30&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Sloka&quot;&gt;Ek so padumá caośatti pákhuŕi
Te madheye nácanti d́omnii bápuŕi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;23..31&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;This is very old Bengali. It means, “There is one lotus flower having sixty-four petals, and in the centre of the petals is dancing Naerátma Devii.” In Buddhist Tantra, Prakrti [the Supreme Operative Principle], who is active in all the manifestations and emanations of this universe, is called Naerátma Devii.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;23..32&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Let us come to Śod́ashii of these ten Mahávidyás. Śod́ashii is also called “Shivá” – that is, “the wife of Shiva, one whose object of meditation is Shiva”. Śod́ashii, who was originally a deity of Buddhist Vajrayána Tantra, was accepted subsequently in Post-Shiva Tantra with a new name, Rájarájeshvarii. Later, in the Puranic Shákta Cult, this deity Rájarájeshvarii was accepted and worshipped, though she was not very popular among the masses. More recently, towards the end of the Mughal period and the beginning of the British period, Krśńa Candra, the king of Nadia, introduced the worship of Rájarájeshvarii, in a slightly changed form and with a new name – Jagaddhátrii. Thus Jagaddhátrii is essentially a Buddhist Tantric deity transformed from Śod́ashii.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;23..33&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;You should note carefully that the worship of Jagaddhátrii was especially popular in Krishnanagar. It is comparatively recent in origin, as it started in the early part of British history. Just as Śod́ashii in Buddhist Tantra was conceived to be the wife of Shiva, Rájarájeshvarii and Jagaddhátrii were also declared to be Shiva’s wives. But how can they be the wives of Shiva, who lived seven thousand years ago?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;23..34&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;It may be a bit irrelevant to mention here, but the fact is that the worship of Jagaddhátrii is carried out in both Krishnanagar and Chandannagar with great pomp and pageantry. An inhabitant of Chandannagar – possibly his name was Gauṋgá Govinda Bandyopádhyáya – was the Dewan, the Prime Minister, of Nadia. Following the example of Krishnanagar he introduced the worship of Jagaddhátrii in Chandannagar also. In art, grandeur, pomp and pageantry, Chandannagar lags behind Krishnanagar. But Chandannagar can claim supremacy in one special area: there the Jagaddhátrii idols are of gigantic size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;23..35&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Anyway, these deities, which originated in the days of medieval Jain Tantra, Buddhist Tantra and Post-Shiva Tantra, were not the wives of Shiva. Some had four hands, some had eight hands, etc., so they were not representations of human beings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;The idea that Brahma comprises both Shiva and Shakti was consummated five thousand years after Shiva’s advent. This is the idea of Ardha-Náriishvara Shiva. It was imagined that Shiva was one: His right side was like that of Shiva, and His left side was like that of Shakti, or Gaorii. One side was plain white, the other side was fair-complexioned; one side was covered with a tiger skin, the other with linen cloth; on one side there was a hooded snake, on the other, the matted locks of Gaorii’s hair. This idea of Ardha-Náriishvara Shiva [Shiva Half Man and Half Woman] represents the inner spirit of Shiva Shaktyátmakaḿ Brahma. True, Ánanda Sútram&lt;a name=&quot;Ref.24.fn1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;file:///home/v/a.m.books/Books/Discourses_on_Tantra_Volume_One.html#24.fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;)&lt;/sup&gt; was not composed then, but the idea was there deep in people’s minds. This Ardha-Náriishvara Shiva was not known in the days of Shiva Tantra, but was very much present in the days of Post-Shiva Tantra. Later on it was accepted in the Puranic Shiva Cult, but subsequently this idea disappeared from people’s minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;24..2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;I saw the figure of Ardha-Náriishvara Shiva in one of the 108 temples on the Burdwan-Guskara Road to the west of Burdwan town. This Ardha-Náriishvara Shiva is a personification of a philosophical idea: that Shiva and Shakti [the Supreme Cognitive Faculty and Supreme Operative Principle] – knowledge and energy - work in harmony. Energy is a blind force. A little child may die of electrocution, because electricity is merely a form of energy devoid of consciousness; being a blind force, it never stops to think that it is killing an innocent child. Thus there should be proper coordination between energy and cognition. This energy, unless guided and controlled by consciousness, may indulge in destructive activities. Thus all the actional expressions of Prakrti [the Operative Principle] are performed only on the vast body of Supreme Consciousness. If Shakti takes one step away from the body of Shiva, it may be harmful. So Ardha-Náriishvara Shiva is a symbolic form of this creation by Shiva and Shakti. Shiva is only working as a witnessing entity and controlling the movements of Shakti with His characteristic firmness, simplicity, and love for creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;25..1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;In those days of matrilineal order, people introduced the system of mother worship, and from that emerged the custom of cańd́ii pújá, the worship of cańd́iká shakti, the power of the group-mother. In those days the leader of a clan would invariably be a woman, a clan-mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;25..2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Sloka&quot;&gt;Yá devii sarvabhúteśu Matrrúpeńa saḿsthitá
Namastasyae namastasyae namastasyae namo namah.
Yá devii sarvabhúteśu Shaktirúpeńa saḿsthitá
Namastasyae namastasyae namastasyae namo namah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;25..3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Translation_Eds&quot;&gt;[I offer my deepest salutations to that goddess who is in all created beings in the form of the Universal Mother. I offer my deepest salutations to the goddess who is immanent in all created beings in the form of the Supreme Force.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;25..4&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Thus the people, being inspired by this idea, developed the system of mother worship in early stages of the Puranic Shákta Cult, in the last phase of Post-Shiva Tantra. Alongside this developed the custom of kumárii pújá [virgin worship], just to please the future clan-mothers. So the custom of cańd́ii pújá gave rise to the custom of virgin worship. One who is a maiden today will be a clan-mother in due course; so it was wise to please these clan-mothers-to-be by offering them something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;25..5&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Thus we see that cańd́ii pújá or kumárii pújá was essentially a social affair, but in Post-Shiva Tantra and in the first phase of the Puranic Shákta Cult, a religious tinge was added to it. This is how the worship of virgins originated. Now this system has almost disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;25..6&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;The situation changed a great deal in subsequent periods. The matrilineal order was stopped, and the supremacy of gotramátá came to an end. Then came the age of the patriarchal system, and along with it the leadership of the clan vested in the gotrapitá.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;25..7&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;The same tradition perpetuated itself even in the patriarchal system; that is, the head of the clan had to be kept in good humour with gifts and offerings. He enjoyed unlimited power, as the clan-mother did in the heyday of the matrilineal order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;25..8&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Cańd́iká shakti is the cańd́a shakti, the great power exercised by the clan-mother. This cańd́ii shakti or cańd́a shakti reached its climax during the days of Post-Shiva Tantra and the Puranic Shákta Cult. We shall say more about Puranic Shákta later. So you understand how the concept of cańd́ii originated.&lt;a name=&quot;Ref.25.fn1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;file:///home/v/a.m.books/Books/Discourses_on_Tantra_Volume_One.html#25.fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;25..9&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Gańeśa was the group-leader of prehistoric days. Some time after Post-Shiva Tantra, in the Puranic Age, a special cult, the Gańapati Cult, arose centring around Gańapati. You should remember that some five cults arose following the Puranic doctrine that had its origin some 1300 or 1400 years back: Shaevácára, Sháktácára, Vaeśńavácára, Gáńapatyácara and Saorácára.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;25..10&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Let us throw some light on Shaevácára [the Shiva Cult]. The main goal of human beings is Shivasamádhi [final enlightenment]. Human beings should direct all their outer expressions of life towards the inner world, and finally merge in Paramátmá. This is the sum and substance of the Shiva Cult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;25..11&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Sloka&quot;&gt;Yacched váunmanasi prájiṋastad
Yacched jiṋánamátmani;
Jiṋánamátmani mahati niyacched
Tad yacchecchántátmani.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;25..12&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;This shántátmá [referred to in tad yacchecchántátmani of the shloka] means Shivátmá [Supreme Entity]; one who merges in the Supreme Entity attains Shivasamádhi, which is the goal of every spiritual aspirant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;25..13&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Next is Sháktácára [the Shakti Cult]. According to Sháktácára, the static principle contained in támasikii shakti has to be merged in Bhavánii Shakti, or Káliká Shakti (the acoustic root for Káliká Shakti is saḿ). And then the mutative principle has to be withdrawn from Káliká Shakti and merged in Bhaeravii Shakti (the acoustic root of Bhaeravii Shakti is shaḿ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;25..14&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Bhaeravii Shakti means energy in action. All people want to come into contact with the mutative force. The acoustic root of energy is raḿ and that for the mutative principle is shaḿ. People want energy supported by the mutative force so that they might enjoy name and fame. So they crave for sha + ra = shra (in the feminine gender, shrii, beauty.) Thus there was a custom in olden days for people to prefix their names with the word shrii. The old custom has fallen into some disuse: shrii is used less nowadays. But I hope that these days people will not become vishrii [ugly]!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;25..15&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Then the sentient forces [or principles] have to be withdrawn from Bhaeravii Shakti, and merged in Kaośikii Shakti, or Mahásarasvatii, the spiritual effulgence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;25..16&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;These are the successive phases of the Puranic Shákta Cult. This cult begins with Káliká Shakti, but Káliká is not Kálii, the wife of Shiva, nor the Káliká Shakti of Buddhist Tantra or Post-Shiva Tantra, nor Káliká the Puranic goddess. Rather, this Káliká is a philosophical term, the inner spirit of a system of sádhaná.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;25..17&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Next is Vaeśńavácára [the Viśńu Cult].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;25..18&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Sloka&quot;&gt;Vistárah sarvabhútasya Viśńorvishvamidaḿ jagat;
Draśt́avyamátmavattasmádabhedena vicakśańaeh.&lt;a name=&quot;Ref.25.fn2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;file:///home/v/a.m.books/Books/Discourses_on_Tantra_Volume_One.html#25.fn2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;25..19&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Viśńu pervades each and every thing of this universe, and because He is all-pervading, He is called “Viśńu”. And the inner spirit of Vaeśńavácára is to realize this all-pervading Viśńu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;25..20&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Sloka&quot;&gt;Viśńuparistitah Viśńuh Viśńuh khádati Viśńave;
Kathaḿ hasasi re Viśńuh sarvaḿ Viśńumayaḿ jagat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;25..21&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;A devout Vaishnavite is seeing Viśńu in everything. Then he sits down to eat rice from a plate. He has a dog on his lap who partakes of food from the same plate. Another scholar who happens to discover that the Vaishnavite gentleman and his dog are eating from the same plate bursts into laughter. He asks how a devout Vaishnavite can eat food from the same plate as a dog. The Vaishnavite replies, “Viśńu in the form of a dog is sitting on the lap of a man, another manifestation of the same Viśńu. Viśńu the man and Viśńu the dog are eating rice, another manifestation of Viśńu. And why are you, another manifestation of Viśńu, laughing? Everything in this universe is Viśńu.” This is the Puranic Viśńu Cult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;25..22&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;The fourth is Gánápatyácára [the Gańeśa or Gańapati Cult]. When the ancient custom of group leadership – gańa-pativáda, vináyakaváda or gańeśaváda – became converted into a cult during the Puranic Age, the idea was adopted that the group-leader was the leader of the universe. “The Supreme Entity is the leader of our group. We will try to satisfy Parama Puruśa.” With this sort of outlook, the Gánápatya Cult evolved during the Puranic Age. They are worshippers of gańapati, the group-leader. This is the Gáńapatya Cult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;25..23&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Last is the Saora [Sun] Cult. This cult was propagated by the Brahmans who came from Shákadviipa. Shákadviipa was the southern part of Russia, with its capital at Tashkent. The original Greek name of this area was Sacdonia. These Brahmans who migrated to India from Sacdonia did not recognize the Vedas or anything else; they were astrologers and teachers of áyurveda. Since they cultivated the science of astrology and astronomy, they used to worship the sun-god, Súrya. The word saora is derived from súrya plus the suffix śńa, giving the sense of “offspring”; saora means “one who is the worshipper of the sun-god”. When it developed into a full-fledged cult, the idea behind it was that the sun-god, who was the creator of this world, was also the creator of the solar system; that is, all the planets – earth, Mars, Mercury, etc. – have come from the sun. The sun is their father. Similarly, the father of this universe is the sun-like Parama Puruśa; so the sun is worshipped as the Supreme Progenitor of this universe. This is the inner essence of the Súrya Cult, which was spread by the Sacdonian Brahmans. But it was not well accepted anywhere in India; it was only accepted to a moderate extent in some places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;25..24&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;These were the five main cults of the Puranic Age. None of them became widely established. Some enjoyed a limited popularity, while some barely existed at all. Some have a philosophical basis, while others do not.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I have a friend, a recluse yogi, who has the ability to heal any disease. He is still alive, but considering the state of collective insanity on the planet, that could very well change. These big brothers have too much burden to carry right now. So that a little dharmic, moral order can begin to influence human society again, there must first be some major cleansing. He says that people trapped in the human, materialistic urban matrices are becoming physically and mentally ill due to the inability to harmonize their physical, mental, and spiritual strata of existence with society, nature, the planet and the universe. This recluse friend doubts if modern humans really are fit to continue evolving on this planet. His opinion matters because to me because I have seen him heal many incurable diseases simply by looking at somebody. These people healed aren’t patients because he isn’t a healer, at least he doesn’t consider himself one. They are just people who happen to cross his path at the opportune time. I dare not give away his identity or his whereabouts because the people would devour him with their troubles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He sees all illness as a projection of mental conflicts or imbalances. By intuitively seeing the illness as distorted thoughts or repressed emotions such as fear, anger, or insecurity, he sees how this flow of mental energy interacts with the organs and glands of the body. Maybe this person can’t tell you so much scientifically about the immune system, T4 cells, etc., but he has been known to heal cancer. Maybe one can’t empirically verify how he does it but it is easy to verify that the cancer disappeared. As a close friend, I ask him how he does it. He doesn’t give away many secrets if one isn’t first capable of understanding them, but one thing I have gathered is that he has some way of taking these illnesses into his own being, like the classic “sin eaters.” Perhaps the cancer of one person gives him diarrhea for a few days, or AIDS makes him physically weak for a few weeks. His advanced meditation and yoga practice constantly heal him of these illnesses. If he stops meditating or spends too much time in the city with the mundane, then he gets ill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What he shared with me is that all illnesses are clusters of unprocessed, unconscious thoughts and emotions that attack the physical body by first creating imbalances in the glandular system. For him not to have the same illness, he must process the thoughts and emotions of the other as if they were his own. If he doesn’t understand these mental patterns behind the illness, then his physical body suffers the same symptoms as the afflicted. I can’t get him to tell me how he does it exactly. He is smug in his non-dualist philosophy and simply says that there is only one being in the universe and this being is only understood by the unprejudiced, tranquil and insightful minds. By understanding this fundamental truth, the mind becomes free of all complexes and relieves the body of having to bear the cross of all of the ego’s ignorance and unconsciousness that create illness and disharmony. He really can explain a little more, but prefers to let people figure it out for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Dada Iishvarakrsnananda or “Dada I.K.” was my meditation and yoga teacher when I was in Ananda Marga. He was the most humane and friendly person I have ever known. I continue to admire his moral courage and feel that his sincerity, discernment, and pure intentions are a great inspiration for many. This is a story he wrote the other day. Its setting is in an intense political atmosphere in India after Anandamurti had refused to stop speaking about PROUT, a decentralized economic theory that he propounded. The communists in the West Bengal state government are attacking Anandamurti and killing his followers while at the same time the Federal, pro-capitalist government is also trying to ban his social activity. PROUT was too transcendental for both the commie state and the Federal pro-capitalist governments and Anandamurti was getting flack from both the Right as well as the Left. Anandamurti’s institution, Ananda Marga Pracaraka Samgha, was later infiltrated by the CBI (which is like the CIA, only Indian). Many of his closest disciples betrayed him while others, like my friend Iishvarakrsnananda, went to jail in his teenage years for refusing to renounce these ideas even though he would have been given a presidential pardon and release for doing so. Many of his friends were brutally tortured and he himself almost died in jail but never renounced his principles. I have never known men with such clarity of purpose as I have known in Dada I.K.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-still-love-them---acarya-iishvarakrsnanada-avadhuta&quot;&gt;I STILL LOVE THEM.  -Acarya Iishvarakrsnanada Avadhuta&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once Baba asked me if I had any questions. I had a question in my mind that had haunted me for around 15 years or more. But I was always afraid to talk to Baba. Either I forget that question or I was too afraid to talk whenever I met Baba personally. The question was not very good. But that day Baba was in very very happy mood and told me that I can ask any question to Him. I got some courage to ask the question. The question has made me very angry and upset. For some time I would jump out of the bed due to anger and hatred towards some sanyasi dadas who went against Baba and put Him in Jail. Sometimes my blood was boiling with anger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told Baba: “I went to Jail before you went to jail.” At the time I was taking care Baba’s quarter in 1971 in Ranchi. I was LFT (Local Full-time Worker) at that time. I was also Baba’s body guard. When Baba left for Patna after Ananda purnima Dharma maha chakra I was travelling with Baba to Patna by security jeep. However, in last minute I was asked to take care of Baba’s quarters in Ranchi along with a few other volunteers. So I came down from the Jeep . It was very painful for me to be separated from Baba. After a month of the departure of Baba the police arrested 33 Margis (members of Ananda Marga), LFTs and WTs (Whole Time workers), all on false charges. Madhvananda and 14 other sanyasi dadas were with us during the arrest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Question to Baba continued, “did the CBI did not know about you as Dharma guru? Those dadas had seen the power of spirituality, demonstration, and power of Taraka Brahma. Those dadas told me many spiritual stories about you. Those same Dadas went against you and made false accusations against you. When I think about those Dadas my blood boils with anger.” When Baba listened to my words, He became totally peaceful. There was total silence. I never have felt such a silence in my life. It was total peace. He held my both of my hands for a long period. He remained in silence for quite a bit of time and then He told me that “I still love them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of my anger, hatred, and frustration was gone since that day. Baba used to say that Paramapurusa (Supreme Consciousness) cannot hate anyone. He repeated this several times in his talks: “Oh human being! what right do we have to hate anyone when almighty Taraka Brahma does not hate any one?”
Baba used to say that “you may like or dislike someone. But do not hate anyone.” Baba was Parama Purusha, Taraka Brahma, and Satguru. Baba was a symbol of love. Baba is a symbol of love. Baba will be a symbol of love. Baba came here to flood the earth with love. Let all of His children work for spreading love. Love will unite us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-power-of-mantra-and-the-power-of-guru--dada-iishvarakrsnananda&quot;&gt;THE POWER OF MANTRA AND THE POWER OF GURU  Dada Iishvarakrsnananda&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I wrote about a saintly Grhii Acarya (Married, Family Teacher), Sakal Deva.
Today I am writing about a serious incident which forced him to join Ananda Marga.
Acaraya Sakal Deva Dada was a fearless person. He was lawyer by profession . His body was well built . I did not have a chance to see him in his younger adult age but even at the age of 90 he used to walk in an erect position. Before he was in Ananda Marga, people were a bit afraid of him. He was bit rough and tough with people. He was not afraid of any one or anything. One day he was walking on the road . He saw a person in a black robe. After seeing the person, he became afraid. He was haunted by fear day and night after that . He went to temples and other religious places to overcome his fear. The lawyer who was known as fearless in Muzaffarpur had become full of fear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one rainy day, he started to run and fell down and was knocked unconscious. Some so-called low cast people in Bihar saw him lying unconscious and brought him near a temple. Somehow these local people knew about Ananda Marga tantric meditation practice in that area. They told him that Ananda Marga meditation will help you. He got the address of an acarya and went to see him but he could not find him there. The family of the Acarya gave the address of another Grhi acarya. He visited him. The Grhi Acarya was very lean and thin person . He wanted to overcome fear at any cost. He wanted to learn meditation but he put some strict conditions on his Acarya. His first condition was that he loves to drink whisky every day. He must be allowed to drink whisky as he will die without drinking whisky. He also eats meat at every meal. He must be allowed to eat meat every day. I forgot his third demand. The Grhi Acarya was a bit nervous. Sakaldev dada told me that to overcome his fear he wanted to learn sadhana (meditation) even if he were to have to force the acharya to teach him if the acharya would not have agreed to teach willingly. He would have easily overpowered him because the acharya was so thin. He was adamant to learn meditation. Finally Sakaladeva dada was taught meditation.. The Family Acarya told him that you may drink your whisky and eat meat every day, but you must practice meditation twice a day as well.
In the Ananda Marga meditation system, the Guru teaches meditation and the acarya is just a medium. Now the job was taken over by the Guru. The power of his mantra started to work.
After few days of sincere practice of Sadhana as per instruction of his Acarya, he went to eat his meat. Afterward, he kept vomitiing and vomiting. The same thing happened with his desire for whisky. When he went to drink whisky he broke the bottle with his bare hands out of repulsion for the whisky.
He gave up eating meat and drinking whisky. He told me that when he went to court, he would always drink whisky before making arguments in the court.. Such was situation of Acarya Sakal Deva Dada before becoming a margii.. Acarya Sakaldeva Dada took the shelter of Varabahaya (the blessing of fearlessness from the guru) and all fear went away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Spiritual Journey and Struggle: Part 3 &lt;/b&gt; -Dada Iishvarakrsnananda
We were a half dozen people in the training center. I was youngest of the trainees. We learned some basic philosophy, worker’s rules, etc. After the training we had to do SPT (Sadhana Piitha Training). We got a piece of cloth to wrap around us but no slippers, no shirt, no shoes.
We had to keep silence( Maona Brata) .We were not allowed to keep any money or any kind of possession. We were instructed to go to beg door to door in the morning and come back before noon. It was very hard thing for me; but I had no choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to go far away from the town; so that no known person should notice me.
One day I went very far away to the tribal village. I had collected some potatoes and rice. I used to utter 3 times “Hari Om Tat Sat” . If they gave me alms; I took them, otherwise, I moved to the next house. I was not supposed to talk and a say any words if some one asks me except “Hari Om Tat Sat” while I was begging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day I was walking on a road when I met a man. He wanted to talk to me, but I refused to talk with him. He continued and forced me to talk. I explained a little bit about Ananda Marga.
He told me that there is gathering where around 50 people are sitting.
“It will be nice if you come there and talk to them about your philosophy,” he told me.
I did not want to go there, but he forcefully persuaded me to go there. I was alone and there was no one else on the street. So I followed him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we arrived at the gathering people were sitting in a court yard and drinking tribal liquor and in the other side some ritual was going on. I wanted to leave the place and I told the person who had brought me there. He told me that he can not do anything as the Sardar ( head of the tribe) is responsible for this place. He told me to speak with the Sardar . I asked permission from head of tribe to leave. The Sardar told me that “you were brought here as a sacrifice to our Goddess. You can not leave this place.” I was surrounded by many people and I started to cry on the inside. The Dadas had told me that if there is any problem that I should use second lesson of meditation. I started to take second lesson, but the mantra did nothing. I was confused, but I did not cry. I was remembering Baba, but it did not work. I started to think that I will be killed and offered to the goddess and no one will know about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The complete memory of my life started to come back. Every one used to love me. All my family members were so close to me. For some time I was thinking about my father, sometimes about my mother, sometimes about my brothers, sisters, and sister-in-laws. Before becoming a Margii everyone loved me so much. I thought about my nephew and niece and how I used to play with them. I started to think that my family was right. I should not have joined Ananda Marga.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will die and no one will know. No mantra, no Baba, no God was going to help me. I was a heart-broken man. Death without reason was meaningless. Every second I was thinking about death. I had lost all hope in God, Guru, Mantra, tantra. I was just thinking about my death every second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had reached there around 8 AM. Almost eight hours had passed there. They were chanting and sharping some axe and sword. I was watching and counting my time. Next they brought some home-made tribal liqueur called “handia”.
I never had any kind of alcohol in my life. I refused it but they wanted to drug me. I was helpless. Four people came and some one held my hand, then some one opened my mouth and kept pouring liquor in my mouth. I did not know how many bottles they put inside me as I was half dead. They brought some rice to feed me but I refused, so again forcibly they put rice in my mouth and I somehow swallowed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to express my feeling about this unwanted death as I had lost all hope.
I had some potatos in my begging bag. One person came and snatched my bag. He told me that he wanted to eat my potato. I gave it to him. Then somebody appeared out of nowhere. He told the man who was going to eat my potato: “do not touch that potato”. He further said: “do not take food from a beggar. This person may be saint, a swami, or god on the earth. If you take his things then I will smash your head.” The person who was going to take my potatos asked him: “who are you?” He replied: “that it is none of your business.” While this was going on a riot broke out. People were very drunk and they started to beat each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unknown person who had appeared told me: “run away from here!,” but I had no energy to move. I was scared to death of the sharp axe and sword. The thought of death was moving through my head as they can kill me at any time. I did not move. The person again shouted: “run away from here!” In the end he came to me, grabbed my hand and we started to run. I was still afraid that they would follow me. We ran and ran until we came to the main road. This person told me: “Go, go to Baba.” Additionally, he said: “I will be here until you reach your place. If any one comes here I am going to chop off their heads one by one.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was almost dark when I reached my place. Dada Shyamananada was moving back and forth in front of Baba’s gate. When he saw me he became very angry. He was very upset. He told me that Baba have not taken food and water since the morning. He has told them if his son does not come He will not eat and drink. I told Dada to go and tell Baba that I am back and that I will narrate the whole story.
He went to tell the news to Baba. After a few minutes Dada came back and told that the food and water which was for Baba has to be given to me. “That is instruction of Baba, there will be no prasad today,” Dada told me.I had wonderful meal. I once told this story to Baba when Baba had asked me how many times he has directly or indirectly helped me. This story was written during Baba’s life in Hindi and later translated into English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;I GAVE THAT POWER ONLY TO YOU &lt;/b&gt;narrated by Dada Iishvarakrsnananda
I had written in a previous story that Baba had given power to Dada Dasaratha to screen people to have personal contact. Dada Dasaratha used to see the mental color of people and accordingly he used to either reject or send the people for personal contact. Once a very important person came to Jamalpur to have Personal contact.. He was sent to Dada Dasaratha for screening. Dada Dasratha entered his mind and saw the person was unfit for personal contact and so he rejected the person for personal contact. However, some top official of Ananda Marga started to put pressure on Dada Dasaratha to approve the person who was very, very important. Dada was in a dilemma. On one e side were top officials of Marga and othere side was Baba’s instruction. Finally, Dada Dasaratha went to see Baba. He told the whole incident. Baba was furious., He told Dada Dasaratha that I gave that power to you only to decide. Nobody else. Do not have to listen to any one. In the end Mr. very, very important person did not get personal contact at that time. Baba was a great master that he did not differentiate between so called important people in society and an ordinary person. His rule was the same for everyone. That was his greatness. Glory to Lord Shrii Ananda Murti Jii.Param pita baba ki Jay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-was-not-able-to-find-someone-to-play-this-difficult-role&quot;&gt;I WAS NOT ABLE TO FIND SOMEONE TO PLAY THIS DIFFICULT ROLE”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;It was the year 1987 and I had came from Hong Kong sector to attend Ananda Purnima Dharma Mahacakar. and RDS. I had a very good news report. I was very excited. Most of the central Dadas were happy about my good news report. But when Baba came to take report from usI was singled out by for for poor productivity. Two other Dadas were also singled out. For poor productivity a punishment was given. Negative microvita were put in certain part of body. The first day Baba made some commenst which I did not like. He asked all the Dadas to keep away from me. No one was allowed to be with me and some were taunting. Some were allowed to make bad comment. Some people were scolding for poor out turn. It was big drama. I felt much pain from the negative microvita which were making my whole mind negative. The next day again was same drama: shouting, scolding, making fun. Taunting, etc. My mind was becoming very negative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the third day when Baba ask me to touch the feet of all Dadas and Didis. I did. I was asked to give a talk . Baba told me to give a talk on the effects of negative microvita. He also told me that to tell people that if they will not work for Marga then they will get negative microvita and suffer tremendously. It was a very difficult situation for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baba also said that I gave many talks in South Korea. In a similar I should give a talk and convince everybody present to work for Marga, otherwise they will also get the application of negative microvita. My mind had became negative but I gave a talk although I was in pain. I almost became mad. RDS was over. We all went back to our place. I was staying in the Upper hostel. Around 1 AM SHUBHABUDDHANANDA.JI(VSS SG) and KRSNATMANANDA woke me up without saying a word. They put me in Jeep and I became afraid. They brought me Baba’s Quarter in Ananda Nagar. I kept thinking the last three days that Baba has been informed wrongly about me. GS dada was lying on the floor in front of Baba’s Door. GS Dada was sleeping. He woke up from sleep and told me that I have been transferred from Hong Kong sector to Manila sector in Bali (Indonesia). He then said to go back to sleep. After that they brought me back to upper hostel. I went to sleep. After Dharma Maha cakra and RDS the meetings were over. I went back to Kolkata.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to meet Baba personally. I request Dada Keshavananda who was Personal Assistant to Baba to get permission to see him, which I eventually did. My mind was still very very negative when I got the approval, but I became a little happy. I entered in to Baba’s room and did sastaunga pranam to Baba and got up. Baba asked about the good news from Hong Kong sector. I started to tell the good news. Baba became very upset and I was asked to leave the room and I left the room Immediately. I was totally shocked, pained, disturbed and confused. The question started to come in my mind about this “good news.” When I came out of the room many dada asked me about my meeting with Baba. I told them that Baba said nothing to me in very angry mood whenever they asked me.
I became very restless and sad. This was worst test given by a Tantric Guru.
I was walking like a mad man in the Lake Gardens. One dada came to me and told me that Baba wanted to see me again. I told him that I do not want to see Baba. I was thinking Baba was going to punish me again. I saw Dada Keshavananda was running towards me. He asked me to go to see Baba. I told him that I do not want to see Baba. My Mind had become totally negative but he grabbed my hand and dragged me and threw me into Baba’s room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I went in to his room Baba was in Kalyan Sundram Mudra . He said to approach him. His voice was so sweet . It is hard to explain in words. Baba said,
“I was not able to find anybody to play this difficult role. You did it best. I have to teach people. You have had to undergo much suffering in this RDS. Come closer and sing me a song.” All of my negativity and the effects of the negative microvita were gone. I was in a different world and different mood. I sang a song but it was not Prabhat samgiita. It was song of the 60’s that I had learned in Dharma cakra when I became a Margii in 1967. I liked the song very much. It was a popular song. I realized I made a big blunder when I came out of His room. I should have sung Prabhat Samgiita. But when you have become mind less, when you do not have your own mind, then you can not decide wrong or right.
Most importantly Baba did not objected when I sang the other song in place of Prabhat samgiita. It was very important for me to see Baba in the Kalyan Sundram Mudra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-gurus-order-must-be-followed&quot;&gt;THE GURU’S ORDER MUST BE FOLLOWED&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 5th,1967 five Dadas were murdered in Ananda Nagar by a communist inspired mob. Baba made a committee of five members to meet Jyoti Bashu who was then home minister of West Bengal. It was a united front government ruled by Bangla Congress, a breakaway group of the national Congress Party and the Marxist Communist Party. Our five members were sent to meet the home minister, including Acarya Lalan who was the first principal of our Ananda Nagar Degree College. When they went to meet Jyoti Basu, the home minister, they were not allowed to meet him and reported back to Baba. Baba asked a question to them. “Did all committee members go to see Jyoti Basu?” The committee members replied, “we all went except Acarya Sakaldeva.” Baba was a bit upset. He said we must take Acarya Sakaldevaji with you. They all again went to see Jyoti Basu to submit the memorandum. As per instruction of Baba All went to see Jyoti Basu.They were allowed to meet him this time. They had earlier violated the instruction of Guru by not bringing Acarya Sakaldeva and that is why they were not allowed to see Jyoti Basu.
The reason for removing Acarya Sakaladevaji from group to see Jyoti Basu was due to some kind of complex in the mind of the committee members. Acarya Sakaldev Dev Dada had very simple dress. He was very simple looking person, although by profession he was a lawyer. He was a family Acaraya (Grihi Acarya). All others were well-dressed. Acaray Sakala Deva is no longer on this earth. He was the acarya of Acarya Svarupananda Avadhuat, Acarya Sujiit Kumarji, and Acarya Nirmohananda Avadhuta, among others. He remained in Ananda Marga and kept working for the Legal Department until his death. He was a saintly and very sweet-natured person. He was great devotees of Baba. He spent some time with me in Delhi Baba’s quarter when I broke my leg in 1999. I also spent time in south ex Delhi Jagrti. when ever I went to India. I always had wonderful Satsanga with him. He is grand father of Prasenjitji who is working with a university in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Pluma Blanca always had a very elevated vibration. When people came near him they would begin to sway in a counter-clockwise direction. Sometimes their heads would begin to tilt and subtly twirl in an almost imperceptible circular motion. He explained that whether you are speaking of the Cosmic Nucleus of Hunab Ku or the Conscious Nucleus of the Atman radiating behind our minds, the movement around either a physical or spiritual nucleus is always a play of the centripetal and centrifugal forces. They have the same dynamics on all planes of being. There are physical vortexes of motion in the physical world where there is the weight and gravity of matter and also vortexes of subtle, mental energy that act and interact with thoughts, feelings, and perceptions. To harmonize the macrocosm with the microcosm, the universe with the individual, one must find this secret flow of Tao both within the mind and in one’s world, planet, and its plants and animals.
On the outside Pluma Blanca’s ancestors studied the movement of the planets and the natural cycles. This practice was never disconnected to the internal practice of meditation. Meditation is the science of seeing behind all of the vortexes and movements of the human mind. A mind that is pure sees into and understands the movements around Hunab Ku, the Cosmic Nucleus that is within us all. Every human being that has truly searched has seen into this great treasure deep within a balanced human existence. We understand that there is always something pure, eternally renewed when we live in harmony with creation. This inspiration has never abandoned us, only we have forgotten It.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-not-so-fleeting-romance&quot;&gt;A Not So Fleeting Romance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pluma Blanca (White Feather), or Quetzal Manik (in maya), came by the clinic for a surprise visit a few years ago. It was my first time to see him. He seemed to know all about me but didn’t say very much. He hardly even spoke Spanish. He liked to talk to me about Tantra and share ideas of the Tantra of the Mayas, the lineage of meditation and healing that he learned from his fore-fathers. Although a healer of all types of diseases, he was fundamentally a mystic who loved to meditate in the forest. He was my wife’s teacher, an indigenous Maya from Campeche. When my wife was attending a European patient he went to the clinic and entered the treatment room directly. He grabbed a pencil and a piece of paper and then wrote down a list of names on the paper. The names were the first and last names of the lovers the young woman had in the last year. The list was a little too long.
He would speak in Maya but nobody understood him. He then began to write to her in Spanish while somebody else translated to her in English. He explained that when humans have sexual intercourse their minds remain energetically connected for 7 years. There is a subtle transmission and continued connection of mental energy shared between the 2 entities. This may be something very pure and harmonious or it may be painful or even degrading, depending on the nature of the relationship. Even though they may never see, nor even think of each-other again, there remain subtle mental impressions that “reside” within each-other.
Another complicating factor is the mental confusion that one carries if one changes or has frequent partners. The imbalanced, frustrated, and distorted energies of others sympathetically vibrate with the minds of an individual person, and vice-versa. It sounded as if he was speaking of the transmission of a mental virus in much the same way as a physical virus, but with the mind and its clusters of memories and emotions as the vehicle of transmission directly into another mind. Instead of being infected physically, one remains “infected” by another’s mind for 7 years. A part of that person’s soul, or subtle mind is carried inside and continues to live inside of another, for better or for worse. The soul becomes an over-crowded house instead of a silent temple.
He explained quite compassionately that her emotional instability was only worsened by her romantic adventures and were gradually making her physically ill. She was an attractive young woman with very liberal values who simply didn’t understand these ideas before he explained it to her. She didn’t feel threatened nor judged, and seriously pondered his diagnosis. I believe that her conscience understood what Pluma Blanca was communicating. She knew she was suffering and wasn’t happy and somebody had just probed into her private life to offer her some clues as to how to understand her confusions. Before the treatment she was terrorizing all of the young spiritually-disciplined boys around here with her tiny, mini skirts. After that treatment she put on a more modest skirt.
### Om in C&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Pluma Blanca was born 114 years on this planet earlier than when I met him, he was a perfect child who always liked to share his toys with me. This little Indian always radiates joy, at least when he isn’t scolding people. On one of our first meetings he just looks at me and mentally says, “first go into silence, hear Om in breathlessness and then take note of its tone.” I could hear the Om sound vibrating within and it seemed to correspond something close to the tone of C. I got my flute out and played a C and it sounded like I was playing at the same tone as the sacred Om sound that was resounding around my pineal gland. Later he said, “Now hear it in C-sharp.” My head went back and I started to lose contact with the outside world and be absorbed into a great white silence that the Om at C-sharp was taking me into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I came back down he said, “now what is in your mind?” I closed my eyes and saw so many images and histories and stories flash before my mind. He continued: “You will verify all of this in the next few years. It will all come to pass.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These events indeed are coming to pass, like entries in an apocalyptic diary. It was the saddest story ever conceived, although the story should soon change for the better. My friend could see the future and help his friends to do the same. Spiritual experiences like this don’t happen so regularly as it is too powerful of an experience for most to digest. The present is challenging enough without knowing the future. Ignorance is sometimes a blessing, but Pluma Blanca knew that it was necessary to understand these things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;nahuatl&quot;&gt;Nahuatl&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pluma Blanca once told me that a Nahuatl is a healer that sees not just into the minds of animals but also into those of humans. Beyond even seeing into the souls of humans the true Nahuatl sees into the Oversoul, the conscious substatum that unites us all. He says that to enter a human mind is usually more difficult and dangerous than entering into a mind of an animal. Humans are less innocent and their mental contents may make such a rare and pure entity as a Nahuatl ill if he or she resonates too close with other human emotional turmoil. Animals see us as gods and naturally resonate with and reflect the mental states of their gods. The nahuatl prefers to see the mere reflection of a human’s problems by “hacking” the minds of the animals under their care. That way, the contact with the other human mind is not too direct and doesn’t affect the seer and also the minds of those seen into. Also,people often feel strangely transparent and often uncomfortable when they feel that another can see through them. Animals, like innocent children, may give very truthful and unbiased information and just tell it like it is. Although a dog can’t speak, they reflect most of this human resonance unconsciously and what lives and vibrates in the mind of the master is also there in the mind of the canine disciple. A nahuatl may learn many things about you through your dog, horse, or even donkey!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been said that very developed tantric yogis have the power of mind over matter in that whatever they put their focused, disciplined minds on will certainly materialize. Though quite rare, there have been numerous examples of yogis with these bizarre qualities through the ages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day Pluma Blanca (White Feather) came to visit bon Nadie at Rancho el Misterio. He spoke much of this phenomenon with practical examples. He said that developed shaman really can even have some degree of control over the weather. This amazed bon Nadie the most as Pluma Blanca was so calm and unsensational while speaking about these abilities. Rather, he took these truths very seriously. He always warned about these abilities, however. “What if you lose control of an emotion and end up manifesting your deepest shadow tendencies?,” he said. He was 110 years old and never spent much time in the cities but he really did understand modern people. The most amazing and diffult thing to believe is when he told bon Nadie that Nahuatls (those who enter the minds of animals) are real and that they can look into the Oversoul of humanity and into the Divine Eye that sees past, present, and future. They can see all minds, not just those of animals.  He said that it is nice to see a human mind from time to time, but he mostly just sees animal minds in human form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way back south, bon Nadie took him to a store to buy some food for the trip. It was an elite part of town. Most people had skin the same color of bon Nadie’s. However, instead of the usual ignorance or normal sociability toward his person, he noticed that some people gave him nasty, scornful looks. They looked even worse at Pluma Blanca. Bon Nadie remained still, just looking back at them. He was in a light, dreamy trance  and saw so much bad history, impunity, suffering and hateful prejudice behind these people’s expressions. He was angry at their ideas and where they come from but still couldn’t judge these superficial people, except to say that they are superficial people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One woman was particularly rude and pushed him to the edge of his patience. She thought that bon Nadie was one of her kind based on appearances. When he didn’t respond to her flirtations, she became downright spiteful and said under hear breath, “maldito indio” or “damned indian.” He wanted to respond and say:  “because my heart is the same as my friends, then I too am a damned indian.” However, Pluma Blanca came over laughing and pulled him out of the store. “Let your wife pay, we will wait out here,” he said. I knew that he knew I was a little annoyed. He sait quietly for several minutes and then responded: “They will get their lessons very soon.” Now Pluma Blanca was known as an oracle and I wasn’t sure if he was speaking about the future of the world and all of the racists and imperialists or if he was talking about this one woman in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that moment the racist woman came out of the store and Pluma Blanca began to giggle like a small child. It was as if he had done something naughty and was trying to hide it. A stray dog approached the woman, raised his leg, and soaked her stockings.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">
    &lt;p&gt;This creation of five fundamental factors is the crudest manifestation of Macrocosmic Citta or Cosmic Mental Stuff. During the introversial phase of the Cosmic Mind, or pratisaiṋcara, the quinquelemental factors came in touch with the divine powers of Puruśottama, the Supreme Knowing Entity, and developed the vibrations of life. The more this vital energy received the brilliance of Brahma or Supreme Consciousness, the more enlightened it grew, and this glow led it forward on the path of self-realisation. The highest of the thinking creatures have been able to accelerate the speed of their unit consciousness ahead of the speed of attraction, or the introversial phase of Brahma. The highest living being was called a human being or mánuśa, which means an intellectual being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development of intellect is not uniform in humanity. No two individuals are identical. In the perspective of time, the people of the ancient past had a less developed intellect than the people of the present day. Millions of years ago, when according to Brahma-cakra, or the cycle of creation, the first human baby was born, this earth was not as safe as it is today. The human beings of that era were completely surrounded by dense forests which were infested with ferocious animals and reptiles – by huge carnivorous creatures with fierce protruding teeth in search of prey. They did not have a sweet home to protect them from thunder, storms, hurricanes and meteors. The scorching heat of the midday sun tried to destroy the very life of the first human babe. This was the kind of environment in which human beings found themselves in those days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such circumstances were not conducive for human beings to develop their intellect or tread the path of self-introspection. In those days people employed all their energy just for their self-preservation against ruthless nature, and during that age of bitter struggle the most important thing was physical strength. In that distant age people realized the value of one thing – that might is right. As all forces were hostile to their existence, they did not feel safe living a scattered, isolated existence. So they came close to each other and formed many small clans or tribes with the sole purpose of self-preservation through collective struggle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In those days the mightiest person of a clan or gotra became the group leader and was worshipped as a hero by the society. Thus there arose in the ancient past the first Kśatriyan society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who first invented the use of fire through friction, who provided that pleasant touch of heat to the human body frozen by cold winter nights, became the greatest of people. This greatness was achieved by dint of merit and not by sheer physical force. Society held such people in the highest esteem as Rśis or pioneers of human welfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later on human beings made food delicious and easily digestible by roasting it in fire. The person who first taught people how to utilize fire was also acclaimed as a Rśi, a disciple of the previous Rśis. Those who discovered the art of weaving cloth in order to clad the naked human body, those who taught how to domesticate animals and provide cow’s milk for babies deprived of their mother’s milk, and those who solved the problems of transportation by inventing bullock carts, all of them were called Rśis. All of them were honoured forebears of human society and all of them are worthy of being remembered, welcomed and revered. The Ŕsis were the harbingers of new innovations for society. Kśatriya society held them in highest esteem as Vipras and lavished them with honour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Years rolled by. Human beings became more closely acquainted with the external world. They learnt to use many more objects and to utilize those objects in a better way. Some people naturally remained preoccupied with mundane objects to make them more useful. This group of people, obsessed with mundane objects, were known as Vaeshyas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a natural rule the Vipras or Kśatriyas gradually become subservient to the Vaeshyas just to seek out an existence. In the absence of farmers no food was available; without weavers no clothes were available – blacksmiths, potters, cobblers, leather merchants, etc. were also indispensable. Generally Vipra society had no alternative but to surrender to Vaeshyan supremacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who were entirely devoid of any of the attributes of the Vipras, Kśatriyas or Vaeshyas became the obedient servants of these groups, but all of these three classes mercilessly exploited such people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world advanced still further. More changes occurred in the social structure. As a natural consequence of the flow of creation human beings discovered money. Money gradually became the means of physical enjoyment. This gave rise to tensions amongst people because the more money one could hoard, the richer one became. If rich people so desired they could own vast property and all the amenities of life. In the Vaeshya-dominated society the Vaeshyas were the most affluent class, and other classes were completely dependent on their money for their self-preservation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Vaeshya-dominated society exists even today, and as a consequence of exploitation, the Viprian and Kśatriyan societies have degenerated to the level of Shúdras. It is a natural law that only a few persons can attain opulence, but the Shúdras are the majority. Today these Shúdras are collectively determined to destroy the domination of the Vaeshyas and annihilate them. There is a clear indication of the emerging dominance of the Shúdras, but is this dominance of the Shúdras an absolute truth?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will Shúdra society remain as the final order? If the control of society slides into the hands of the Shúdras, won’t the material prosperity and the spiritual progress of humanity be obstructed? As a consequence of the struggle for Shúdra domination people are coming to understand what type of social pattern will ensure the genuine welfare of society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No social class should dominate society. If one class is dominant the other classes will surely be exploited. Therefore everyone is to be guaranteed equal opportunities and equal rights. For the progress of humanity a harmonious adjustment in the society is essential. A good many genius students are compelled to drop their studies for want of money, and for the same reason many artists are obliged to curtail their extraordinary talent. This is due to a defective social order. This state of affairs cannot be allowed to continue any longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cunning capitalists have built a fragile nest from their greedy intellect, just as the weaver bird builds a nest. In the collective interest of all human beings this nest must be smashed to pieces. Only then can human beings lead the entire society towards supreme good. Otherwise only a handful of people can ever attain perfection. Unless there is a complete transformation, it will be extremely difficult to lead the whole society to the supreme stance. The intense clashes and conflicts of the physical world will continuously turn people’s attention to external objects of enjoyment and create obstacles in the path of their spiritual progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a harmonious social order no one will run after fame or wealth like a mad dog. A congenial external environment will assist in acquiring psychic balance, and people’s internal poverty will gradually decrease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sa tu bhavati daridra yasya áshá vishálá
Manasi ca parituśt́e ko’rthaván ko daridrah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Those whose [[desires]] are vast become poor: If someone is mentally happy, who is wealthy and who is poor?]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O human beings, build the social structure considering the needs of humanity. Do not try to do anything for your petty personal and group interests, because whatever little you want to do with your limited outlook cannot last. The cruel touch of time will annihilate your aspirations into an oblivion that you cannot comprehend. It is not necessary to study books to know how to work, how to do, how to retain and how to renounce. Rather you should look upon every living being of the universe with sincere feelings of love and compassion. Only then will you realize that whatever you make, retain or break is generated and controlled by the Supreme Entity. In that condition you will realize that all your positive and negative activities are embedded in the all-blissful state. Through action mixed with devotion and knowledge you will find the meaning of your life, the supreme treasure of your heart. This treasure you have unknowingly kept carefully hidden in the golden casket of your heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sei ánanda caráńa páte śad́ rtu ye nrtye máte
Plávana vaye yáya dharáte varańa giiti-gandhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[With the silent footsteps of the Supreme Entity the six seasons burst into dance. The whole world become inundated with welcome songs and incense.]&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">
    &lt;p&gt;I was an admirer of the Zapatistas since the first videos that I saw early in 1994 when Commander Ramona, an ex-nun Zapatista rebel commander, led the attack to take San Cristobal de las Casas in Chiapas. Even though they had machine guns and were fighting and killing I could see that they were very dignified people by the look in their eyes behind their masked faces. The noble eyes behind their masked faces as well as the brightly-colored indigenous clothing underneath bullet belts and machine guns revealed who these rebels truly were: organic farmers. I felt there was an invisible grace guiding them. I didn’t quite know why, but I just felt this very strongly as a first impression. It was a very lucid realization for me that awakened a strong sense of social and moral responsibility and activism. Later, the brilliant, humane discourses of the Zapatista commanders and sub-commanders like Ramona and Marcos revealed that there was such a beautiful and humane spirit guiding them. They won so many hearts around the world with their earnest discourse. Although I was a student in the U.S., I was drawn to them and attended some talks by Liberation Theologists priests that were Zapatista sympathizers who came to speak at the University of Texas at Austin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was soon distracted from the Zapatista movement, however, by my involvement with some yogis in India who turned out to also be revolutionaries. Although I admired Indian yogi-revolutionaries like Aurobindu and Subash Chandra Bose, I was personally more yogi than a revolutionary and I thought of these Ananda Marga yogis more as monastic social activists who practiced and taught yoga to keep themselves and human society physically, mentally and spiritually strong. I never thought of them as the machine gun or grenade carrying types until they made a debacle of an arms drop from a Russian airplane full of machine guns, rocket launchers and grenades over their main ashram in Purulia, India. I knew nothing of this side of Ananda Marga and had just accepted work being a Ph.D researcher in their university in Ananda Nagar where I was living at the time when the arms drop shattered this dream. I ended up in prison and then a long house arrest period while our accusations of being possible terrorists were being litigated in the Indian Supreme Court. I was interrogated by Indian intelligence, the CBI, but they were never interested in me and knew that I knew nothing. I only discovered the truth that A.M. was involved in all of this later, after I had given so many press interviews that the fat cats in A.M. arranged in which I defended A.M.’s innocence. I was their informal speaker to the press for a short period. They said I looked really innocent and used me as a cover. I was very non-attached to the situation and instead saw it as a fun game until I realized I was lying for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philosophically speaking, I have always favored non-violent ideas and a more strict idea of ahimsa or non-violence. The idea of “just” wars has always disturbed me but war is a reality of this world that always haunts the pacifist. The Zapatista revolution helped me see that sometimes the most moral and responsible people have to make these most difficult decisions and truly take action. I had just finished studying Steinbeck’s “The Grapes of Wrath” at the end of 1993 and was reminded so much of the mentality of Steinbeck’s Jim Casey (J.C.), ex-preacher turned revolutionary, kind of like Comandante Ramona. Whenever I thought of the Zapatista plight I remembered my internal revelations and the look in the eyes of the rebels and I simply hoped that these good people would be guided from on high. However, the Ananda Marga failure made me see how extremely difficult such a revolutionary decision really is. Certainly West Bengal needed a revolution against the communist dictators, but Ananda Marga fell so short of victory in this humiliation and instead showed the world with each new and continued scandal that it was but a spiritual mafia with a really twisted and corrupt vanguard of priests who only vaingloriously preach the words of their master like silly parrots without having done anything productive and substantial in decades. Those people remain within. Those few left who are really doing the work are forced to be rebels and work outside of the corrupt organization. Their projects continue because they truly help people and people in turn help them.
Just after the Zapatista revolution and during the Ananda Marga debacle, the subtle discourses of the Zapatista commanders like Ramona and Marcos showed the world that the Zapatistas were not violent terrorists nor communists but very noble and dignified people who had no other alternative for the survival of their indigenous culture other than taking up arms. Their allies of Liberation Theologists, intellectuals, humanists, and righteous hippies soon came to their aid and have since then formed a very positive international society of humanist-intellectual activists to ally the indigenous Zapatista revolutionary community. They voluntarily put down their arms without surrendering them and have instead been building schools and cooperatives for the indigenous communities of Chiapas and have been the most powerful and recognized voice of resistance against capitalist globalization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anandamurti wasn’t anti-violence in the strict since like Gandhi. He saw a well-planned revolution as humane in that there is a quicker end to injustice when peaceful means are exhausted. However, he never said “it is time, let us revolt and start a war now.” My opinion is that he would have been very pleased with the revolution of the Zapatistas, their ideals, and the fruit to come from those actions and ideals. I see nothing closer to the ideals of Prout co-operativism and economic decentralization (the social outlook of Anandamurti) than with the Zapatistas. I am afraid the wayward disciples of Anandamurti who planned the Ananda Marga arms drop lacked the discernment of when to use force (what else is a huge airplane full of weapons dropped over their main ashram to be used for other than violence?) because they ended up in utter humiliation and have endangered their whole social movement thereby. They ended up making it on the FBI’s top ten terrorist list for several years. If these amateur revolutionaries wouldn’t have attempted the arms drop and other shady activities they would have only had to deal with the negative propaganda of the very corrupt and dubious Indian government and would perhaps still have some respect in the world eye. I know that A.M. was heavily infiltrated not just by Indian CBI but also by the CIA and FBI. I met informers during my house arrest who confessed to me their involvement in A.M. mafia activity that led them into having to be informants rather than go to prison for long periods. I don’t doubt that the fall of A.M. was aided by international intelligence that always protects the global capitalist system. The quick rise of Ananda Marga in India during the 60’s and 70’s made many people nervous. Neither the Indian CBI nor the CIA wanted this spiritual and social revolutionary movement to spread beyond India, as it quickly did. Nowadays, after the death of the great leader, Anandamurti, this expansion has stopped and the movement falls apart everywhere. I recently heard about an Oxford publication where the author speaks of A.M. as a jihadist movement! Although this is far from the truth, it is true that Ananda Marga is no longer such a vigorous and respectable movement and it certainly isn’t an easy task being an Anandamurti apologist! If the social and spiritual ideals of Anandamurti are in fact true and tested, then they will live on, perhaps in better ways and forms, and with practical examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One does not hear of anybody calling the Zapatistas a jihadist movement, however. Perhaps one would if they would have failed. I admire the Zapatistas for their courage to confront a Hydra physically much more powerful than they. However, what I respect most about this movement isn’t only that they were great warriors but that their continued success has really been sustained by a very well coordinated international solidarity movement and a very deep indigenous wisdom guiding them. When I hear their maxim “Para todos todo, nada para nosotros,”(For everyone everything, nothing for us) I can’t help but hear the Perennial Philosophy of non-dualism sprouting up from Chiapas in a very unique, special and rebellious color. However, I love the fact that there is no religion or sectarianism for the Zapatistas. It is much more interesting to see their silent, natural spirituality manifest through honest sincerity and practical humanist ideals.
It has had a very unique effect on modern human consciousness, at least for those who have approached them. I really do see them as dignified organic farmers who would rather be with their families on their land instead of having to fight another war. I try not to even consider the idea that there could be war again. I don’t think it is out of fear of violence but rather the belief that there are also undiscovered and unseen ways to fight a revolution against petty materialists. If peaceful, conscious, and collective organization and the moral dedication to a new ideal of living was not working, then they still would not be around after all of these years and would have been annihilated by the Mexican government. They obviously have had the support of enough people to have made their movement a success. The mature rebels of the world have to keep helping them and other non-vanguard and local grass-roots movements to continue to move forward in peace and a wise resolution of these seemingly insurmountable problems that the whole planet faces under the Capitalist Hydra.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The year before last was at the height of this so-called narco war in Northern Mexico. The narcos controlled the whole region and the local village. There was a command center 2 kilometers from our home where there were human skulls hung on the fence. Many of the local men were hired as lookout scouts to inform them if there was going to be an attack. The people in the village were very destitute and poor. Many families had inadequate food and clothing while the men spent their money on beer or crack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rancho Misterio began organizing some social service activities in the community. We even organized a mass with a very good Catholic Father in which the chanting of Baba Nam Kevalam was incorporated into a mass which the father gave. Giitanjali continued to take our crew to sing kiirtan twice a week with the community members. I usually stayed behind in the ranch with the heavy artillery in deep meditation and confident that nothing evil could befall my family. During that time the locals would pray to the Virigin of Guadalupe before and after singing kiirtan. During those times my meditation was so full of beautiful Christian ideas. I felt so closely the divine, motherly aspect of the divinity. She never appeared as a form, but rather the love that fills all space between all of the stars of the universe. At that time I realized the Virgin of Guadalupe has a shawl bedecked with stars and that the image is really a mix between an indigenous goddess and the Virgin Mary. I never really knew much of Catholicism personally but always knew many very good Catholic people. In my own way I had many internal apparitions and it was nice to feel like I understood the underlying meaning of the Divine Mother behind this image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that same time, there was an apparition of the Virgin of Guadalupe over the village. Everybody who wasn’t drunk saw it; that is, all of the women and maybe one or two of the men.
What I learned from this is that the divine cannot ultimately be trapped in any image but rather may use images to express deep truths.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">
    &lt;p&gt;Shame bears a resemblance to the vrtti, lack of confidence, in the second vortex.  The difference between them is that with lack of confidence there is a generalized, pervasive inferiority regarding one’s fundamental self-concept. Shame is a contraction of the expanding Manipura personality due to a disruption in one’s self-image.  The punitive and oppressive feeling of blame and the corresponding self and/or social judgment of the ego being inferior, a failure, unworthy, ill, base, sinful, etc. are due to activities and interactions of the ego that have transgressed social forms or boundaries or have failed to meet the expectations of the social environment.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shame is an ugly image of all of the negative judgments and transgressions from others that one has identified with. They begin to overpower and convince the ego. One’s very own Aham suffers the imposition of others but this affected Aham continues imposing the same negative judgments upon itself with shame as the result. For example, most victims of racism must somehow believe that he/she is inferior to actually feel shame. An external thought form has been internalized and painfully felt due to the inability to deflect it and not accept it internally. The Aham begins to live by a negative form of another that imposes on the weak self-image. Shame is also generated internally by failing to meet one’s own expectations.  The Manipura mind lives by an image, whether one’s own image or a socially imposed one.  If one falls short or transgresses one’s own values and beliefs, then the mind is no longer nourished and inspired by the positive image. There is a rift between the real self and the ideal form of self. Shame enters and one feels an emptiness, lack of meaning and a distinct sense that one is ineffective in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shame, whether generated from within or without, is essentially the failure of the ego’s activities to meet the demands of its ideal form or pattern of behavior, its conscience.  Initially conscience is an imposed guiding pattern of behavior determined by external, social forces, but as the ego develops conscience becomes more of a thought form that guides the self towards greater realization of its potentialities in accordance with certain psychological and spiritual ideals.  Shame can be induced by a transgression of the personal, subjective conscience as well.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Ubuntu;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt; Shame functions in few positive ways. It can be a compensatory system of checks and balances for antisocial behavior or behavior that goes against ones own ideals.  The feeling of blame and transgression and their effect of inhibiting the negative activities can actually keep one from persevering with such harmful behavior.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Ubuntu;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt; While shame can serve a positive purpose by keeping impulsive behavior in check, most often it has a crippling effect on the motivational powers.  This is especially limiting when the social conscience is very rigid, strict and punitive, thereby making it very difficult for the individual to meet those imposing expectations.   It is the same with self-judgment within the individual as well.  All too often it is the rigid subjective conscience of the individual that perpetuates its own sense of shame by setting up unreal expectations for him/herself that can&#39;t possibly be met.  Whether induced from within or without, they both lead to an entropy and contraction of the evolving personality.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Ubuntu;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt; Shame is often the great demon behind the monstrous face of a really negative personality.  When one feels unworthy and base, then the mind will naturally gravitate toward what is low and base.  Nobody wants to feel the weakness of shame and to feel empowered one may use manipulative and aggressive means that aren&#39;t necessarily helpful. One may resent the positive qualities of others because of their own sense of inferiority and can become aggressive, competitive, invidious, and hateful.  Or perhaps narcissism and vanity will try to cover up one&#39;s self-disgust.  Looking behind all of the masks of the negative aspects of the ego the demon of shame projects and controls the negative self-image.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Ubuntu;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt; The shame complex, like any other complex, is resolved when one finds a true form and meaning for the personality.  Instead of feeling bad, low, and unworthy, one must find a vital, creative and healthy self-image to put one back on the path of balanced growth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Ubuntu;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt;2. Slander&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Ubuntu;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt; It has already been mentioned that the Manipura Vortex directs the vigorous outward expansion of the mind.  Here the will endeavors to acquire a certain power and mastery over the objective world.  When there is some sort of frustration to this power drive the mind seeks a way to overcome the obstruction in order to make the will stronger than the impediment.  Slander is the attempt to negate the fear, doubt, and insecurity caused within the subject by the force (another person or group of persons in most cases) that obstructs the connection of the subjective will to the objective environment.  This negation takes the form of berating and belittling the self-created “enemy” in an attempt to psychologically weaken the impact that this enemy actually has on the ego.  In this process the fear evoked from others is distorted and projected. While the will is attempting to overpower the crippling effect of the offending parties, the slandering ego feels that by defaming another that they are actually negating and weakening them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Ubuntu;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt; With this tendency the mind is still very deeply entrenched in a very marked and dualistic self/other dialogue.  The slanderer derives a mental momentum and empowerment from its slander by feeding off the negation of the other.  This negation functions as a defense mechanism to keep the dynamism and power of the will and self-confidence intact. However, the potential for positive expansion out of strife and conflict with others is hampered.  The ego is basing itself upon a negation of others.  This cycle of conflict continues until the Creative Mind seeks refuge in a higher order of intelligence and insight.  This perspective isn&#39;t reached until this marked dualism is overcome with judicious discernment at the Anahata level.  It is not just this particular vrtti of the Manipura that keeps one confined and bounded to the world of external form.  Rather, all of the vrttis of the Manipura with their willful ego-oriented power drives are associated with a weak ego image.   An effort of will guided by a very positive idea is needed to overcome these weaknesses and fears that cause conflict with other egos.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Ubuntu;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt;3. Jealousy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;              &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Ubuntu;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt;Jealousy is always related to shame. Behind jealousy is the belief that one&#39;s own qualities, abilities, performance, etc. are inferior to those of others.  If one were to simply notice the positive qualities of others without thinking of them in the context of one&#39;s own desires, then there would simply be a recognition of another&#39;s qualities and abilities.  But because the mind at this level of development is so preoccupied with its own ambitious tendencies it makes a comparison to itself. Seeing oneself as lacking these desirous qualities, one desires them for oneself.   Instead of creating a novel self-image, the weak Manipura Vortex with jealousy derives its significance by emulating the image of another.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Ubuntu;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt; This vrtti is related to and can induce so many other tendencies.  In many cases a latent lack of confidence (second vortex) affects the thought processes in such a way that one&#39;s thinking is always about what one doesn&#39;t have.  It is this lack of self-worth that very often makes one susceptible to jealousy.  Jealousy affects and activates other tendencies of the Manipura as well.  Jealousy is so often responsible for hatred, fear, and slander.    Once the feeling of jealousy arises in the mind it is all too easy to begin to passionately hate the adversary that you’ve self-constructed, and who is there better to slander than those you hate?   And does not this negativity and sense of comparison and competition with another induce even more fear as well?  Perhaps you won&#39;t ever match up to the other.  And perhaps an underlying sense of fear was responsible for the jealousy in the first place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Ubuntu;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt; The jealous, invidious mind must find the strength to value and respect its own qualities and process of growth.  With jealousy one is completely disregarding oneself as a creative process.  The person is a microcosm with a definite plan and purpose, evolving in the path toward union with the Macrocosm.  Within the person are all of the latent qualities and forms of intelligence to help find a sense of dignity and self-respect. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Ubuntu;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt;4 and 5. Staticity and Melancholy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Ubuntu;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt; When the will projection of the ego at the Manipura level is unable to link itself to its environment and thereby sustain its psychological economy, there is a devitalizing effect on the mind.  The energy accustomed to moving outward loses its objects of desire, its chain of gratifying objects.  Since the identity of the ego is so externalized on objective forms outside of itself, the loss of this object of desire and meaning (artha) for the ego is experienced as an actual loss of self.  The causes of this are numerous- excessive stress, illness, other psychological issues disrupting balance and harmony in the mind, existential crisis, to name a few.  All of these occurrences that create a rift in the economy between internal desire and external gratification, can lead to the feeling of inertia and staticity.  In this state the mind lacks the vitality to seek its pleasure and happiness because of this split.  This is staticity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Ubuntu;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt; When this condition becomes more intensified or is prolonged melancholy ensues.  Melancholy can be likened to psychic stupor in the 2nd vortex as they both are generated from the ego&#39;s inability to make a link with its environment.  While psychic stupor is a reaction to a stressor that can uproot the entire psychological foundation, melancholy is a more refined expression of this in that the devitalizing of the mind is caused more by a loss of personal meaning.  The mind at the Manipura is more refined and complex than at the Svadhistana and therefore the disruptance of the mind at that level is caused by the mental associations at that level and also respond with a reaction based on that level of cognitive and emotive functioning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Ubuntu;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt; Melancholy, according to Kristeva,  is &lt;i&gt;asymbolia&lt;/i&gt;- the loss of meaningful symbols and forms that the personality has been attached to in order to define and orient itself.  The depression is due to the fact that the ideas that have supported the personality are no longer functioning in the same ways.  There remains only a void. This can be caused by a disruption in the environment or social world or by a change within the personality that makes it difficult to adjust in the customary manner.  In both ways is the personality is at a loss of how and where to reorient itself to a meaningful identity.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Ubuntu;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt;6. Cruelty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Ubuntu;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt; As mentioned previously, the psycho-evolutionary step toward the Manipura level of mind represents a much-heightened degree of self-consciousness by means of a more refined Creative Mind and a drive to expand it toward the external world.  Here the psyche itself actually begins to be a somewhat conscious object for the intellect.  We saw that in order to have shame, slander, jealousy, inertia, etc. it was necessary to think of the ego and its qualities as  reference for the ego image.  This concern is certainly present, however it is greatly obscured by the other ego-centered, impulsive and impassioned tendencies and therefore the pure and lucid contemplation of the personality is not yet possible.  However, it is quite an achievement for the mind to be making an indefatigable though impulsive effort to overcome the torpor of the Svadhistana.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Ubuntu;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt; With the propensity of sadism there is a very thorough but mostly unconscious recognition of the limitations of the ego along with a feeling of self-hatred and disgust.  One unconsciously sees all of the limiting tendencies of the 2nd and 3rd vortexes and looks upon oneself as a pitiful nonentity.  Instead of consciously recognizing these self-perceptions they are displaced and projected onto others who have these same complexes.  Therefore, the complex that is so unconsciously despised within oneself is consciously recognized in another along with all of the corresponding self-hatred.  With this defense mechanism the tension arising from self-disgust is directed toward another and that other thereby becomes the scapegoat for one’s own shortcomings.  Hence, the old maxim that one really hates most what one sees in oneself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Ubuntu;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt; Sadism, this tendency to inflict harm upon another in order to protect oneself, is expressed in various ways ranging from violent, physical aggression to contemptuous remarks and teasing, to witch hunts and Auschwitz.  Like slander it is a defense mechanism that feeds off of others in order to try to maintain a psychological equilibrium.  It bears a deep resemblance to resentment at the Svadhistana but is a little more psychologically complex in that now the fiery Manipura tendencies add even more fuel to the fire of hate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Ubuntu;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt;7. Blind Attachment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Ubuntu;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt; The propensity of blind attachment serves the same function of compulsion in the second vortex but at a higher stage of mental development. Again we see how the propensities recapitulate themselves in a higher, more consciously evolved form. At each successive stage of development there is a variation and evolution on a psychological theme, a variation in the protection, sustaining, and expanding tendencies of mind in accordance with the increasingly refined and more conscious stages of development. This evolution of the mental structure arises not just through clash and cohesion in the mind but also due to an innate guiding faculty deeper within the mind. Ultimately, the all-attractive power of Consciousness leads all minds back into their Supreme Subjectivity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Ubuntu;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt; Blind attachment gives an unquestionable and rigid sense of certainty to the Aham. Here the ego has moved into newly acquired territory that isn&#39;t thoroughly mastered and controlled. The social world with all of its complex ideas is a great challenge to the mind that was so previously immersed in its more native, primal instincts. In order to secure a niche in this more complex world of image and form without confusion and self doubt as to whether one has the vigor and fortitude to face the challenges of a higher order, the mind clings to either to its previous achievement or the ideal modes of being that it sets for itself. The name and form of the ego or the ideals of the superego are rigidly, even fanatically upheld. But why must this be blind attachment instead of simply another lighter attachment. It must be blind so as to be unquestionable. The impulse is like a photon that after having been released through fusion in the suns core bounces around in the body of the star colliding with other forces until, after millions of years, it finds its way to the surface where it is free to pursue its momentum in a vaster space with less hindrance. The birth of consciousness must move forward, never backward, and this blindness secures, at least for a while, this forward momentum. Again, viewing this tendency from a higher, calmer, discerning perspective makes it seem limiting, but blind attachment certainly has its place for the insecure ego. However, as we expand our creativity and awareness it is necessary to overcome our irrational insistence, demands, fanaticism, and manipulative tendencies that blind attachment fosters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Ubuntu;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt; Although one may be blindly attached to another person or social group for a sense of security, in the end one is always attached to one&#39;s own image. Our own sense of identity and worth is still determined by being recognized by others. Blind attachment is not yet love, because it seeks out of desperation and takes more than it gives. However, everyone calls it “love.” A good friend of mine once said “What is love but repressed hate?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Ubuntu;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt; Any image casts a shadow. Shame and fear and suffering are in this shadow. And, in most cases, this image is sustained by a vague expectation how you think others should see you. So much fuss over what is not even your own! If one must hold to an image, then it must be as light as possible. Truly, one is free to live by or create any image possibly conceived by the mind. The problem is that any image created in this microcosmic existence in time and space is that the finite image always bounces up against the eternal flow of your immortal existence. It is much better to flow with Tao, the cosmic moral order, than against it. You can&#39;t hide from your Self forever. At the base and essence, behind fear and trembling, we know it is all just a story and that we haven&#39;t get began this new, inner life. The life of the separated ego image is determined to receive reactions according to how one&#39;s image has shifted, metamorphosed, or distorted the natural flow of expanding human consciousness. There really are inner laws of harmony which we must learn not to transgress, but rather complement and further them. The vain ego image, because of its very nature and place of inception, will always suffer reactions and this shame will always bind one to the concept of a limited and mortal identity. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Ubuntu;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt; Fearlessness is the only path to wholeness. The wise who see beyond the limits of the Aham and into the Mahat are the only ones who could play the game of the image correctly. Without escaping life, they move right through it. The personal, spiritual self is but a name to the nameless, an image given to you to help you function in this world so as to eventually free yourself. “Time is a moving image of eternity” said Plato. Only within this relation to the infinite, eternal, nameless being, do we find our own true name and nature within time. Spontaneous, natural and free, the inner, mental reflection of Self (your true image) flows really well with life because one could never presume upon it. Love and sincerity are much more real than any appearance to mask suffering by putting on a fine show exhibiting limited qualities. Being sustained and ensured by the Infinite, the realized soul puts fear and worry aside and lets life be lived care-free, as a joyful channel for the Infinite.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol start=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Ubuntu;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt;Ambition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Ubuntu;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt; Ambition is the continuous propulsion for the mind toward physical and mental forms for the purpose of expanding its arena of activity and understanding. The Sanskrit word for this vrtti, trishna, literally means thirst. It is an insatiable thirst that underlies the ego&#39;s desire to be something greater. Ambition is the focus of will on desired goals and the unswerving dedication to realize them. Like shame, it is one of the few tendencies in the Manipura that can actually be growth promoting, even when viewed from a higher level of psychological development. Ambition want to make what is outside inside, what is ideal real as the Aham acquires personal significance and social recognition by these achievements. For ambition not to be a force that consumes the Aham, it must be guided with a pure desire for growth and expansion that is not rooted in forcefulness and aggression. Ambition is misplaced desire for expansion and purpose. One wants to build castles in the world by worldly means and completely ignores the vast potential of intelligence and meaning that is within. So often ambition takes one contrary to this path which is finally a path to liberation from suffering and delusion. Infinite desire is only satiated with an infinite object of pleasure, which obviously doesn&#39;t exist as a possibility of experience for the human mind at the Manipura. Our misplaced notion of infinite desire projected into the external world is actually a projection of infinity from within. Only that which is unstained and unmoved by any vibration is infinite, anything else is a finite wave with a beginning and end. It is only deep within the subjective witness of the mind that we find the ever-present Shiva. This Supreme Subjectivity is always present behind the mind and ever ready to take the mind back to its source of awareness and bliss. The mind must be prepared for this by following the path of dharma, or inner, psycho-spiritual movement. This is so hard for the ambitious, externalized, form-oriented Manipura consciousness to understand. It is only when we find a true and meaningful purpose that takes us toward a higher level of Self awareness that it begins to be possible to contemplate the infinite within and live within its joy, its ananda. The growth and understanding that helps substitute love and optimistic expansion for selfish ambition and manipulation is how the person begins to have a sacred reverence for his/her own existence and respect that same sacredness in all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Ubuntu;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt; A friend of mine was once seated in front of Anandamurti. Anandamurti was mentally scanning his Manipura Vortex calling out the propensities one by one and saying “very good, no shame, slander,” and so on until he mentioned “What is this, a little ambition?” He said that it was alright and that it could stay because he was channelizing this vrtti with a lot of social service activities inspired by higher propensities. His lesson from this experience was that as long as their exists external desires it is possible to channelize them toward something really positive with the creative power of the Manipura Vortex guided by noble intentions from the higher vrttis. This way, one fulfills the wants of the propensity of ambition in the Manipura while at the same time transmutes the selfishness of the desire into a more conscious goodness that is shared with all. It is certainly not easy, but it is really the only way out of the hell of selfishness and greed that forever suffers a delusion of controlled and confined happiness. As such, ambition converts into true expansion, a tendency in the Anahata spiritual heart, and leads one toward unbounded yet tranquil happiness in this world as well as the next.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Ubuntu;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt;9. Hatred&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Ubuntu;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt; Hatred resembles very closely the propensities of slander and sadism. The main difference between them, however, is that slander and sadism are active aggressive expressions while hatred is more of a deep, seething hostile feeling toward another that doesn’t necessarily have to express itself overtly but may stimulate these other these vrttis as well. It is a constant state of aggressive tension between the self and the other. It justifies all sorts of negative expressions in the personality toward another being that is constantly under one&#39;s negative evaluation. A little bit of hatred may be repressed or ignored or may escape through passive-aggressive gestures or comments. Intense hatred may lead to terrible altercations and even aggression. Very often hatred is a constant and general attitude toward a world considered hostile or unjust. Every situation or person that threatens the ego is hated. Hatred is an armed assassin always ready to do some dirty work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Ubuntu;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt; In a poem of Byron it is written, “he knew not what to say so he swore.” When the mind cannot assimilate a clash to the ego, the effect of the situation remains unprocessed and all of this raw, unprocessed mental tension remains inside, gnawing away. It is interesting to note that the vrtti of hatred escapes outward from the center of the Manipura Vortex directly towards the liver. Any form of hatred must be understood creatively to catch its blindness. Very few people are educated about emotional life. Normally, one learns how to manage negative emotions only after they have become a serious problem that requires major changes due to crisis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Ubuntu;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt; Hatred is a lack of the creative abilities of the Manipura. If the higher, conscious parts of the personality are not vigilant, then hatred as well as other negative propensities will worm their way in. Hatred is so often one of the key culprits in the shadow of the personality. It remains there because one doesn&#39;t know where else to put it. One tries to hide and suppress it, but it always finds a way out. Situations and people that provoke negativity will always exist, we can only change how we evaluate and react to them. One must learn to see the sequence of events, external as well as internal, that led up to the feeling of anger and reinterpret and channelize them in a different way. To begin overcoming hatred it is necessary to re-envision one&#39;s being in a more harmonious manner that isn&#39;t based on separation, fear, desperation and conflict. Hatred cannot exist well where there is love and understanding and all of the other mental alchemy that goes into the transcendent act of forgiveness. Hatred is often a reaction to a prior, unconscious interpretation of a difficult situation. This energy remains embedded in the mind perhaps an entire lifetime. Perhaps one still remembers insults from elementary school and while recalling them flushes crimson. Or perhaps one is frequently involved in imaginary arguments with a parent. And just imagine what happens if a real, present person moves into this imaginary space of projection! This person will receive the past hatred of the others history. The buried emotions that have festered inside may be violently vomited out while the ego seeks to resolve this issue by blaming another for its malcontent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Ubuntu;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt;10. Fear&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Ubuntu;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt; Fear is certainly the most prominent feeling that pervades human life. Much that was said about fear of annihilation at the Svadhistana Vortex is relevant to this vrtti in the 3rd vortex. Just as many of the foundational tendencies of the 2nd vortex are translated and transmuted into the expansive and vigorous tendencies of the 3rd, fear a more complex and conscious form of the pervasive fear of annihilation. Fear is not necessarily terror in such an unconscious and pervasive sense, but rather reaction to self doubt. One doubts the strength and ability of oneself to uphold the psychological projections, activities, and attachments that constitute the identity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Ubuntu;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt; At this stage of development the mind has a clear degree of separation from the objective world (nature and culture) but instead of being motivated toward true transcendence of relative and finite bondages, it substitutes the potentially pure understanding and conception of form and idea with a limited and egocentric version that merely gratifies the ambitious and passionate appetites of the limited and separate self sense. Because the will enforces itself through blind attachment, craving, slander, etc., it is very unwilling (and yet incapable) to let go of its egocentricity. Behind all of these instincts for self expansion in the psychic and conceptual arena is the fear that the link between the internal, subjective will and its definitive external attachments will be severed. Fear is this perpetual concern over the loss of self, at least a self defined by its cravings and demands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Ubuntu;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt; Fear has many forms and many faces. At the most superficial level, there is fear about the acceptance of the social mask, or persona. Once we find a little more confidence, authenticity and individuality there will still be the fear if this acquired image can be sustained. Even in the highest degrees of development where one begins to have a notion of dharma and the sacrifice of the individual will for the collective welfare there will still be the fear that the lower propensities may hinder.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Ubuntu;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt; The Manipura level is the realm of the self and world that is defined by an impulsive and egocentric will. It is not until the propensities of the Anahata compensate for these limitations that the self begins to intuit that the world and self are not held together only by its own will, but is directed by a divine and moral order. The Manipura can capture this idea. This understanding is the only way to overcome the fear of losing the grasping, craving and defensive separate self. The only way for the Manipura to be strong and healthy is to serve a master greater than itself. Only through knowing Brahma is there an end to fear.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Ubuntu;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt; Of course, the spiritual Warrior archetype is what manifests in the Manipura mental level to guide one toward the spirituality in the Anahata Vortex. Under this influence, which is a co-mingling of Manipura with Anahata and Vishuddha propensities, the mind&#39;s selfish desires get transmuted into a greater effort to struggle to follow one&#39;s conscience. Any Warrior needs a master and the spiritual Warrior archetype is so closely connected to the guru archetype. The Manipura Vortex still can&#39;t let go of images of itself, so it is no surprise that the mind looks for an image or archetype for god. Instead of being lost in the heroic ego trying to free itself from lower worldly bondages, the mind seeks to understand a higher, internal meaning based on a nobler idea than those based on selfish desire, blind attachment and ambition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Ubuntu;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt; In the Hindu epic, the Ramayana, the 10-headed demon Ravana is a symbol for the 10 propensities of the Manipura Vortex. The god Rama is the hero who slays this demon. The Creative Mind of the Manipura can grasp these ideals and put them into practice. The divine archetypes descend upon the mind according to time, place, and person. Although most people worship these internal ideas in the extroverted religious sense, the developed Manipura mind understands the true significance of these forms and that they have an archetypal, “guiding function” as Jung termed it. It is this deep understanding of conceptual forms that gives the creative, Manipura mind its genius.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Ubuntu;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt; When I was a boy I was very curious as to whether Christ really existed as a human being or was a deeper, more universal, spiritual archetype embedded in the human conscience. This curiosity disappeared as I began to meditate and understand that the divine grace is always present behind the tranquil mind. I understood that the divine was in the formless I-Witness of the mind. This is what yogis call the Atman. Words and concepts and even the highest philosophy cannot trap the infinite within their limits. What I longed for was this harmony and union instead of a standardized conception of “god” which always seems to go along with some kind of acceptance of religion, cult or tradition. Although I had so many dreams of my teacher Anandamurti in which He often told me very important things and even healed me, I could never allow my mind to get locked into concepts like “guru.” Perhaps I could accept this authority on the inside, but when people started speaking of “guru” in the social context, it was so often based on other people’s conceptions of what the guru is and not so much their own experience and deep realization. This is true in any form of spirituality: the masses follow set standards and concepts and don’t put much energy into realization. However, it was in the height of my realizations of the formlessness of the divine that I had so many experiences of divine forms! Anandamurti, in dreams or meditation, always guided me toward the formless, actual presence of the Atman and never said anything like “I am the only way.” These experiences always revealed what i saw as deep universal truths. My mind had connected with this particular form that revealed truths so far beyond form. There even once appeared to my physical eyes the luminous form of Christ after a deep meditation. I had no doubt there was a divine presence manifesting as a form. His form was translucent and the jade serpent that i had seen in my first kundalini experiences was seen just behind his eyes at the level of the mid-brain. I clearly understood that it was a symbol of the union of heaven and earth and of god and humankind. The “serpent power” of the kundalini, the divine energy latent in the base of the spine, awakens into the brain and transforms us into something inconceivable for the Aham. This serpent at the mid-brain was completely tamed and within the beauty of the totality of the beautiful head of the Christ figure. I thought of how such an enlightened brain must have incorporated the so-called reptilian and mammalian brains into the mystical, yet to be realized potentials of the human neocortex that has evolved above and around them. Christ is a symbol of this yogic perfection, at least in my experience. The vision was more beautiful and meaningful than anything I ever saw in the Louvre or any other museum in the world. When I recall it I return to that state of ecstasy in the present. As time goes on I understand this as well as so many other visions of true form as deep spiritual truths that one cannot normally grasp without the help of the medium of form.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">
    &lt;p&gt;In ancient Indian Tantra Yoga the mental ideation or concentrated thought for the practice of meditation is taught as “I am That” or “I am Brahma.”  For the extroverted mind without intuition of the Supreme Subjectivity of the Atman it is quite necessary to use an objective mental concept like a mantra to refer to “That,” the mystery of mysteries, especially in the beginning.  Who understands silence and what lies embedded in the silence underneath the wavering, coquettish mind?  Without an objective, descriptive idea of the Supreme Subjectivity with the qualities of love, light, bliss, or even a personal being with human-like qualities, this contemplation of the Atman is impossible for most.  It is only when the mind has matured and internalized and understood the problems and complexes related with the personality and its external, social world and has developed intuition and self-reliance in spiritual and existential affairs that it is possible to begin to understand the Atman or Supreme Subjectivity as a “This” instead of a “That.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After so much sincere practice, the sweetness of Om reveals the blissful essence of the Atman as the essence of one’s person.  Atman is inconceivable for the mind’s intellect and ego but is in no way “impersonal.”  The heart usually knows this simple truth well before it is so furtively and constantly churned away in the mind over so many lives and deaths.  Atman ultimately is revealed as what is most near and dear, closer to me even than my eyes or nose or hands.  Atman is within the very notion of “I exist,” It is the I-Witness.  Now, I only see, so “I am This” becomes a more natural form of ideation.
The mind is usually too involved in unresolved conflicts of the psyche and/or social world to be able to have this deep spiritual confidence and simply be Oneself.  This Atman, this “I-Witness” is far too close to be considered an object, a “that” or thing outside of Oneself.  Even the most refined concepts of divinity are but maps and references that refer to what is inconceivable for the mind.  Eventually we encounter subtle in-originalities, things acquired along the way that served quite a good purpose but no longer quite express our honest and direct truth.  Fine wine becomes vinegar some day.  In Ramakrishna’s experiences of samadhi he held on so firmly to the image of the Great Mother archetype until he finally had to shatter even this loving image to merge into the transcendental Atman beyond even broad-minded vibrantly charged religious concepts.  One fine morning the Zen master shatters his little Buddha figure.
“This” implies greater closeness and points deep within and cannot be confused with the image of the ego and its concepts that are witnessed from above by this Supreme Subjectivity.  The mind cannot distort this intuition because it cannot even grasp what is not idea, a “that”.  The Atman sees all but is not captured by what It sees.  The Atman, contemplated in peace and silence, totally consumes the whole notion of “I am,” much less any idea like “I am a Buddhist,” “I am a Christian,” or what have you. This notion of ego, of “I am” is the progeny of the Atman.  After sporting about in all orbits of time and space for eons, mind always finds its nucleus as an immortal and ineffable Witness.  Older than all stories ever told, only the Atman’s perspective gives a positive reference for our persons in a fleeting and ephemeral world.  “Yes, I have been with you all along, has there ever been anything meaningless?”, is the voice we  all long to hear.  Atman then dissolves and liberates the mind like a spider who in some strange manner recovers and consumes its own Self-spun web.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;My mother once told me of an incident when she was with her mother in a grocery store in Alabama in the early sixties. They arrived at the end of the check-out line. The people waiting in front of them were all black ladies who were waiting for their turn to pay at the register. As convention would have it, the ladies left their position and tried to get behind my grandmother at the end of the line. My grandmother wouldn’t let them. She said that they were there first and that they should go ahead of her. The other white people were offended by this. What is another white person coming in here for and breaking the rules of our established order?, they said. This happened in the early sixties before the Civil Rights Movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 90‘s I lived in a spiritual community in rural Missouri where many members were from India. The locals would come and shoot their rifles at us, try to burn down our buildings and shout “Sand Niggers!” (which is actually a racist term for Arabs, but what does a hick know?) We would call the police because the attacks came almost nightly. They said they would patrol the area. The attacks didn’t stop, they just never happened on the nights the police came. I had never heard of Ferguson before recently. It may have been very near where we were, or at least very near in mentality. Without the protection of the local government, we had no other alternative but to defend ourselves. There was debate in our community over whether we should have a gun. I even caught one monk making a Molotov cocktail in the garage. I argued with him about it even though I internally thought it was so hilarious to actually see him doing something so crazy. In the end, we ended up working together making booby traps like falling logs with spikes that would fall and puncture their tires when they entered. Let us have fun, non-violently, I argued. I suggested throwing rocks, but at their trucks. I would climb high in a tree and throw rocks into the beds of their trucks. Them stupid hicks had no idea where it was coming from and thought we were shooting at them. I once caught a truck load of them in one of our traps and shined the lights on them. They were terrified. They hadn’t been so frightened since that time their meth lab exploded. Every one of them had a mullet, except for the bald guy with a swastika tattooed on his scalp. On another occasion, we trapped the entire front-line of the varsity football team inside the gates, all five of them seated together and aligned in the front seat just like on the football field. They accused us of firing a rifle at them a week before. They asked me if I knew of the incident. I said that I only heard some people shouting “Sand Niggers.” I asked them if the “shooting” happened before or after the shouting. One said “before”, then his identical twin brother, the big, dumb center, looked confused and tried to cover for him by saying “after.” The quarterback, the smart one, then said, “we didn’t say that!” We really only gave them a good scare and a few dents in their truck. It was all pure and innocent fun on my part.
It was easy for me to laugh at their ignorance and I found it ironic that I lived in a community where these brutes actually came to burn a cross in our yard. However, I am a white boy who has never suffered these abuses personally and who is only just beginning to understand how detrimental these negative sentiments toward others truly are. If one understands racism, and sees how prevailing these attitudes are over the entire planet, then its no longer such a funny matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I live in Mexico and am married to an indigenous Mexican woman. I would have never imagined the racism that we would encounter. We once lived in a very elite area. I soon discovered that the Mexican elite are almost all of European descent. It is simply amazing to see how these blood-lines have remained unmixed over so many centuries. It was just like being in the United States. Many people there spoke English as well as the average American. I could have fit in if I wanted to, but there weren’t so many interesting people. Many people assumed that my wife was my servant. Only our friends accepted us being together, and many people who we thought were our friends really were prejudiced against us. I wasn’t personally offended but just accepted the fact that our circle of true friends was just a little smaller but dearer.
This experience showed me how damaging racism truly is. Victims of racism have deep scars that are difficult to overcome. Entire societies carry these wounds for centuries, even for milennia. I could see that this elite Mexican society, although much prettier than my Missouri hillbillys, were often just as ugly in their mentality. They both have very exclusive breeding circles and value being white over all else. These elite at least can buy a lot of cocaine instead of having to make their own crystal-meth. Living near these rich people made me think of the Old South in the U.S., South Africa and the old colonial attitudes. I read in BBC a few years ago that Mexico is the country that has the greatest gap between the rich and the poor. Only through the greatest corruption and exploitation is that possible. We were close to the people who influence society and decide its policies and met people who work in the government and for big corporations. The higher you go, the dirtier it gets was always what I heard in their confessions. It is so painful to think that these superficial yet insidious people have formed so much of the modern world and that their racist ideologies are still very much alive. It is the same situation all over the world. Imperialists have always had to kill off or at least totally paralyze the cultures of the indigenous all over the world to steal their lands and resources. The British were the first global narco-traffickers who took down China with opium. Europeans still use corrupt African regimes to create instability to divide and conquer economically, while Canada and the United States continue using Latin American bureaucrats and their police and military forces to steal whatever they want, from whomever they want and anywhere they want it. So that a few can live in opulence, the majority are condemned to live in rank poverty. Imperialism makes the world of the exploited a living hell. However, these shrewd parasites can never escape their conscience, no matter how dormant or distorted it is. They may make, manipulate, or distort social laws, but will never escape natural law. As a natural, mental reaction to their attitudes, the elite and their supporters hate themselves for all they have done. A part of them is aware of what they are doing but project their self-hatred onto others through racism to try to justify it all. The more they transgress, the more they are punished with self-hatred and the more they need to send it somewhere and find a scape-goat. They have already sold their souls for bad ideology to intellectually justify their base desires. These “ideological” mental traps only make them more psychotic. Nobody escapes the law of karma and it eventually all comes back upon us. We accept societies lies and abide by them. Maybe we don’t pull the trigger personally but our conventional attitudes and social and ecological ignorance permit it. Anybody with a sensible consciousness in the “first world” can see that our society for the most part has become a total failure and is already consuming itself in its own entropy. Much of modern human society is something the Gia, our live and sensible planet, no longer needs and no longer wants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Narcissism is the soul killer. Most people don’t understand that the mind is a living, conscious entity that can be destroyed by reckless, ultimately meaningless, materialistic actions. Mind is a subtle entity that exists between the body and Consciousness. We live in such artificiality and crudity that we forget we have something really vital within. Our mental and soul architecture is designed to evolve, but can also degrade. If the mental plasma of the mind vibrates too much toward matter and a narcissistic ego image, this mental plasma becomes more crude like matter, which creates a state of entropy and involution. Such a mind invites energetic parasites in the form of “negative” microvita. Negative microvita are like termites to the mental structure and only help the unfit, distorted mind to destroy itself more quickly. They can be thought of as mental-energetic viruses. These mental parasites come in the form of physical and mental illnesses, uncontrollable compulsions, and extremely distorted thought patterns. They are but archetypal patterns in our collective consciousness that are activated by our resonance with the thought forms that they help to project within us. These thought forms have a particular resonance with our bio-psychological system of glands, hormones, and neurotransmitters. Ask anyone who has ever fallen into the dark side of the soul but has been fortunate enough to return. There is always some kind of guiding pattern that really helps one work against ones well-being; a perfect path to destruction and disintegration of the personality. The more one resonates with this unconscious actuality, the more it becomes a conscious reality. Of course, “positive” microvita also exist and have the same archetypal guiding function, but in the reverse, growth-oriented way. They bring us to greater awareness and help resolve the conflicts due to the negative microvita patterns in our minds. They impose a greater, more conscious and humane form on the old, negative archetypes of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So much of the elite, the shrewd, the cultured, don’t even know how to live well and are truly without culture. Not just the upper elite, but much of the upper middle-class and “new rich” have similar attitudes. People live mostly by forms and images that aren’t their own. These socialites lack real, authentic identity, and their inner “I” feeling is so inter-twined with their swindled possessions, property and their shady, exploitive activities that the human being inside becomes ill. Their consciousness has been converted into a sick mind that only desires matter and narcissistic pleasure. The underlying paranoia of the separate, superficial ego begins to make the mind even more desperate to satiate itself. This stress wreaks hell and havoc upon the nervous system and the organs because the body was never meant to be the temple of unending, unlimited indulgence. They are condemned to solitude, as narcissists can never love. Instead, they become ill, physically, mentally, and spiritually. These degenerated patterns in the mind fortify themselves and become negative archetypes for all who think and feel in the same manner. There remains almost nothing to their character other than some warped conventional attitudes and a superficial mental form adorning an underlying brute instinct. The materialistic ideas of capitalism as well as communism and the very limited mental structures that have projected these materialistic ideas are but termite-ridden homes. When these ideologies guide the mind, then the whole society becomes mentally imbalanced. The collective human consciousness begins to degrade. A human being cannot live without a natural human spirit that seeks a greater understanding of the universe. I think it was Maslow who said “the normal in society is the psychopathology of the average.” Welcome to the Zombie Apocalypse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around where we lived in the north of Mexico, most men are alcoholics. The economically privileged go to prostitutes and their “gentleman’s” clubs and indulge in cocaine and alcohol while the women divert themselves with shopping trips to the U.S. and secret rendezvous with their lovers. My wife once had a patient with pancreatic cancer. He was a rich businessman with some practical intelligence but a very mundane, hedonistic life-style. Through strict discipline that he followed, she eventually cured him from what his doctors said was fatal. Elated, he went to Las Vegas to celebrate. His cancer came back and he died a few weeks later. On the day that was to be his last, he sensed the end was near and summoned all of his energy to be able to go out for one final steak dinner. At least I can say he was congruent with his ideology to the very end!
Humans who didn’t learn enough about their own humanity create families that are like mental institutions. Children are emotionally abandoned and completely vulnerable to all of the pseudo-cultural influences and vices. Drug and alcohol addiction is about the same as those in the poor barrios. Oh if only they were destroying just themselves in the process! However, these parasites accumulate everything but only let it rot in their coffers while destroying whoever gets in their way. They really set the precedent for the rest of the corrupt, shallow, mean-minded materialistic society that envies and follows their example. But who really wants to hear all of this? There are bills to pay and things to buy and so many lies to tell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last few years here in Mexico I have seen things that I can hardly talk about with myself and my closest friends. I had to make sure the dogs were very well fed because of all of the human carnage in the near-by mountains. Mass graves became too much work. Later, they just started dumping the bodies by the road-side. However, I know there is a greater eye that sees all of this and can put it into perspective. I have seen remarkable examples of heroic resistance to this terror from the most simple and faithful people who inspire me.
A lady in a local village ran out of her home during a drive-by shooting against her family. She ran straight toward the assailants shouting “Baba Nam Kevalam,” a mantra that means “there is only love.” She rushed upon them and took the gun out of the hands of the teen-age assassin. They had never encountered such fearlessness and were simply stunned. We have lived through hell here in Buchenvald, Mexico. But these are passing, human affairs. And what is humanity but a passing affair? The earth is still alive and is really about to show us as such. “Those who protect dharma are protected by dharma.” The only time I have ever feared losing my life was in a state of spiritual emotion when I was so overpowered by an inner joy that I thought it would sweep me off into the Infinite before being able to see the full awakening of the Sixth Sun and the return of “Mexico Indio.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3 id=&quot;the-spiritual-heart&quot;&gt;The Spiritual Heart&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can begin to understand the reasons for the limitations the egocentric
“I” notion that distorts the pure reflection of Hunab Ku in the human mind
by examining the spiritual heart. Within the spiritual heart or Anahata
Vortex exist the roots of our divided and fragmented modern consciousness
but also the qualities of compassion, understanding and unity with the true
“I” within. Pluma Blanca explained that all of the expressions of the so-
called “vortexs” are balanced by the spiritual heart, what yogis call the
Anahata Chakra. I prefer to use “vortex” instead of “chakra.” The
traditional concept of the Anahata Vortex is a lotus with 12 petals. Each
“petal” is a vortex spiraling out of the greater vortex or “lotus,” like many
small tornadoes that group together to form one giant vortex. These petals
or minor vortexes are known as vrttis- vortexes of mental energy. These
vrttis vibrate the entire mind and body and qualify them so as to express
particular states of thought and emotion. Vrttis are the fundamental
intelligence behind our thoughts and feelings, the hidden programming of
human cognitive and emotional life. The Anahata Vortex is subtle like the
higher vortexes with their finer, cognitive tendencies, but at the same time
has grosser qualities like the lower vortexes that express more instinctual and
egocentric tendencies.
In the Anahata there appear to be two hexagons. Really, there is one.
They seem different because one moves clockwise or centrifugally, and the
other moves counter-clockwise or centripetally. Here we can see the
fundamental yin-yang or centrifugal-centripetal interplay of the universe at
work within the human mind. These are 12 points at which the balances
and imbalances of the human consciousness may express themselves in a
refined way. When there is perfect balance and there is no escape through
any vortex or vrtti in the 12 vertices, Hunab Ku always enters the human
mind through the spiritual heart with its neutral force of consciousness or
citishakti.
The right side of this plexus is solar or centrifugal. The left side of this
plexus is lunar or centripetal. The centrifugal force under the control of the
witnessing entity of Shiva becomes the Son, the primordial creative
expression of the Supreme Consciousness within the human and personal
medium. It is for this reason that the Vedantic sages meditated on the right
side of the spiritual heart, the nexus of where the super-personal Atman
“touches” the personal and human.
The left side is the Mother of God, the centripetal shakti that always
brings the expressions of the Son back to the neutral force of
consciousness. The centripetal force never lets the centrifugal force
become entirely lost into manifold expression and always brings it back to
center. Together, in balance, these binary forces of creation manifest in the
human being to the grade that there is a balance in the 12 vortices or vrttis
at the 12 vertices of the 2 hexagons. When there is less duplicity,
arrogance, vanity, and selfishness(negative vrttis), and more love,
discernment and faith (positive vrttis), then the process of the unification of
the microcosmic consciousness into the Macrocosmic Consciousness of
Shiva is well under way. It is here in the spiritual heart of Anahata that the
nameless godhead may evolve a name for itself, for us, within each of us.
The Dynamics of “Ka” and “Kha” through Hope and Worry
The vrttis or vortexes of the microcosmic mind are subtle sounds that
result from the tension of internal and external mental movements. They
are evolutionary efforts to guide and direct the microcosm in its march
towards union with the macrocosm through yoga. These sounds are subtle
in that they are vibrations created from tensions in the psychic, non-
material realm. They are heard through deep concentration. According to
tantra, are the 50 fundamental mental vibrations of the human mind that
when spoken audibly form the Sanskrit alphabet. Vowel sounds are causal
and unmanifested ideas in the Macrocosmic Mind. They are beyond time
and space. Consonant sounds are effects of the causal mind that control
the manifestation of more tangible tendencies of the microcosmic mind.
This is the reason that in tantric meditation much importance is given to
the use of mantras which are intelligently organized from these
fundamental sounds.
The sound “ka” is the first sound at the 12 petaled lotus of Anahata
Vortex. “Ka” is the first consonant to break out of the causal sound matrix,
or logos, of Brahma. With this sound vibrates the great idea of hope, that
everything created comes from bliss. At the anahata level of consciousness
we are so aware of ourselves and our world. It is important that our lives be
meaningful and useful and move in a spiritual direction. True hope is the
practical knowledge of “I am That”. The eternal I-Witness, the Atman,
sustains and guides my every movement. It is knowledge that everything
that comes my way, comes from Brahma. Eventually this pure movement
of “ka” weakens and is distorted, then we put our hope in relative issues, in
our petty ego, in religion, politics, or the like. Hope is divided by worry,
doubt, and fear that our meaningful reality structure will not endure. Worry
is the second vrtti of the Anahata Vortex and will always counterbalance
hope until hope is honed into a pure and unwavering Self-confidence.
Together, these two vrttis represent the fundamental duality of modern
human consciousness. Hope is “ka”, and worry is “kha”.
The fundamental lunar, centripetal, and introverted sound of “ha”
descends to ka, thus making “kha”. The lost mental movement that has
dissipated into false hopes is brought back to center with the addition of
“ha” to “ka”. “Ha” has the capacity in and of itself to bring any errant
microcosmic movement back into balance. “Ha” controls the internal,
centripetal movement of the mind. It is an aspirant, exactly between the
end of the vowels and the beginning of the consonants and thus functions
as a mediator between the visible and invisible, the causal and the
manifested effect. The following vrttis that continue to unfold reflect this
dual movement of an externally-moving consonant paired with the
internally-moving “ha” to balance that consonant’s movement when it
weakens.
Hope
The function of the microcosmic mind is always the medium between
the inner identity and its outer world, be it a physical, mental, or spiritual
worlds. The Manipura (3rd vortex at the navel), with its craving and blind
attachment, attempts to will desired things into being. With the qualities of
the Anahata previously described one would expect to find a vrtti that helps
bring an inner desire into being in a more discerning and less impulsive
manner. Hope is the inner belief that what one truly and deeply needs will
manifest itself into being. With the purest hope there is no manipulation by
the will to bring the event about, but the self rather relies on the power of
belief and faith to bring wish into reality. So the medium of the activity of
this vrtti (as well as others in the Anahata) is neither through the sensory
and motor organs nor the imposition of will, but through the eminence of
intuitive thought.
Of course people often hope for selfish and trivial things due to the pull
of the Manipura vrttis on the Anahata, but the propensity of hope
potentially has the sublime function of giving one an inner sense of
knowing, despite any lack of empirical, sensory experience. When the
Anahata is purified it has the capacity to understand the meaning and ideal
of form in the deepest sense. When the heart is pure one can intuit the
underlying meaning of a given situation. Here one’s own elevated thinking
can apprehend the subtle, cosmic intentions that are being thought into
being by the Cosmic Mind. An inner sense of certainty ensues from this
along with the belief that goodness will somehow come to fruition, despite
the limitations of the personal will to force it into being.
The power of faith or hope is one of the most profound capacities of the
human mind. The reason that faith has been so highly regarded as a great
virtue by all of the so-called higher religions is that it places the power of
will into a force higher than the individual will and egocentric authorship. It
thereby helps to bring about the realization that the cosmic will is supreme
and gives one even greater faith in the benevolence of the cosmic moral
order. This inner, intuitive certainty further inspires one to transcend the
turmoil and incessant anxiety of a self separated from Brahma, the
Supreme Self.
Worry
While hope gives one the secure conviction that their own welfare is
dear to Brahma and thereby relieves the perpetual burden of a fearful,
limited self having to pine and struggle to assert its identity by coercing
and shaping the objective world to its will, worry is exactly the opposite.
When one is worried or excessively concerned over an event or an inner
ability there is a lack of faith or hope that things will turn out for the good.
The outside pressures or the internal inadequacies seem to be the causal
factors regulating life instead of a hidden, intelligent order. And because of
this concern over the preponderance of outside circumstances and a lack of
inner strength and confidence, the fretful ego may resort to its habitual
methods of asserting itself. Instead of a reliance on dharma or Tao to bring
things into fruition the worried and separated ego reverts to using its own
isolated will, mundane intellect and Sensory Mind. Instead of the ego
relying on the guidance of the quiescent eternal “I” or conscience, it uses
its own mental projections of the objective mind to fulfill its own end.
Here the fulcrum has shifted toward the negative pole. The pressures
and strains of a more complex consciousness aren’t directed to one’s own
higher intelligence and therefore the higher mechanisms (hope,
discrimination or rational judgment) aren’t used to cope with the
contradictions and limitations of the separate self. Instead the ego may
lean on its old habitual behavior patterns to deal with the more complex
struggles that a higher consciousness must bear. Here we have the
misplaced situation of a mind capable of deep and abstract thought but
only using those deep and idealistic thought processes to think about the
difficulties of a situation while the activity used to solve the issue come
from a lower, previous levels of awareness.
This paradigm is exactly the issue plaguing the present level of human
evolution. The upper end of the bell-curve of human consciousness is in-
between the stages of the Manipura and the Anahata levels of
development. Although there is a great degree of this new-found self-
awareness and rational intelligence, it doesn’t yet understand its own true
significance (as well as that of others) and how to apply this knowledge to
the world at large. How else can one explain how intelligent and relatively
civilized people use their shrewdness and technological understanding to
ruthlessly exploit nature, manipulate economic forces at home and abroad,
and wage war over oil? This leap in awareness at the Anahata is certainly
the saving grace of humanity but if that awareness doesn’t incorporate and
integrate the previous mental structures (the Manipura and Svadhistana),
then all sorts of complex mental issues arise, such as duplicity, selfishness
and repression. This will be a common theme throughout the Anahata
Vortex: whether one uses one’s higher intelligence to continue developing
psychologically and spiritually or whether this greater development of
consciousness and intelligence simply becomes a tool to exacerbate,
exploit and perpetuate the impulsive vrttis (craving, blind attachment,
sadism, etc.) of the Manipura.
The Dynamics of “Ga” and “Gha” through Expansion and Love
The spiritual heart is the Anahata Vortex. Anahata means “not holding.”
It is the intuitive level of mind that begins to understand that there is an
infinite vastness and dignity inside itself and can begin to let go of blind
attachments caused by an underlying sense of fear and insecurity.
The intuitive mind of Anahata vibrates in tune with the Aerial Factor, a
very fine form of matter or prana that manifests its intentions toward form,
yet being beyond form itself. When completely purified this prana no
longer needs to vibrate with the vrttis or vortexes of the mind. The breath
stops completely. One is empty of form, but full of bliss. One hears the
inner logos of Brahma, all the sounds that make up Om, and sees how fine
vibrations of prana manifest the entire material universe. These rhythmic
vibrations or “strings” or pulses of prana stem from the “root” sounds of the
Causal Mind, the logos of Brahma. One day the human genius will be able
to map and even quantify these fine vibrations that make up the so-called
“quantum void.” Then, human beings will begin to understand the secrets
of the dimensions between mind and matter.
Until this placation of the spiritual heart, the vrttis of the Anahata will
continue to guide and develop our awareness toward this understanding.
These fine sounds of the vrttis will vibrate the mind and attempt to
regulate the endocrine and nervous systems so that they can develop
higher functions. The 3rd and 4th vortexes of the Anahata Vortex are
controlled by the sounds “ga” and “gha.” “Ga” manifests a tendency
towards self-expansion and development of latent qualities, and “gha”
manifests a tendency toward deep, human affection, or love.
Before the manifestation of the vrtti of expansion, the mind’s
“endeavor” is really expansion of the ego based on conquests of physical
space and material or acquisitions psychic meaning for the separate,
fearful, ego-dominated personality. This is the world of action and reaction.
The separate ego is always trying to find meaning and security to
compensate for its isolation and fear. One tries to fit into the social and
economic systems with ready-made patterns. These patterns most often do
not harmonize with the cosmological order and we suffer reactions
accordingly.
With the vrtti of endeavor at the Anahata the latent qualities of the
Macrocosmic Mind, the repository of infinite, omniscient knowledge, can
begin to manifest themselves. New qualities, interests and subtle desires
begin to manifest in the personality. It is a psychic instinct that directs us
toward greater meaning at the intuitive level of mind. Where did your
spiritual and creative desires come from and when exactly did they start?
What hidden force directed you toward certain people, certain places,
books, or practices that opened up your inner spiritual life? At the intuitive
level of mind we begin to realize that there is an inner vastness that is
really living our lives and really knows how to do it. One only has to
convince the separate ego to go along with this flow.
“Gha”, the vibration that regulates affection, is the counter-balance of
endeavor, or “ga.” Knowledge via expansion of the mind is useful to solve
existential problems and it is imperative that this knowledge be developed
in all spheres of existence- physical, social, psychological and spiritual.
However, no form of knowledge is complete without love, without a greater
human purpose for this knowledge. At the anahata level, reason and
affection aren’t yet separated. Head and heart are one. And it is possible
that all of the finer human qualities and intelligence may serve us not in an
accelerated collective destruction, but toward universal love and justice. It
is only when the warmth of deep human love is missing that the mind
becomes a rogue mind that constantly devours itself and others and keeps
itself forever separate from the intuitive order of existence. Spiritual
knowledge without the development of the finer, loving qualities of the
personality is an impossibility. This level of love is not yet universal
compassion because there are still finer needs of personal significance.
However, the development of these higher emotive functions eventually
lead one toward universal love or compassion, a quality of the Vishuddha
(5th) vortex, an even higher level of human consciousness. Here, one is so
close to the Atman that there remain few, if any, personal needs and one
only loves without any expectation or desire of reciprocation. When
Anahata is purified it becomes a direct conduit for the Causal Mind of
Vishuddha.
Endeavor
Endeavor is the effort to unfold enfolded or dormant qualities of the
personality. We see that with the Anahata that there is the ability to think
in a very deep and meaningful way. With this sublime ability the mind can
probe into the deepest grounds of thought potential to discover and create
new modes of being for itself that further the expansion of human potential
and knowledge of existence. At the Manipura (3rd vortex) there was still the
impulsive hunger for expanding the mind in relation to its external
conceptual world. With the vrtti of endeavor the mind can expand itself not
merely by assimilating more of its outer environment, but by finding inner,
intuitive qualities that broaden and enlighten the concept of self. Endeavor
is the effort to discover who we really are on the inside. Now that there is a
greater degree of Mahat (self-reflecting awareness, “I exist”) and therefore
intuition, with a corresponding decrease in the externalized intellect, the
mind begins to question what the “I” truly is. At this stage the personality
is very well aware of the limited ego-driven tendencies and seeks to know
the reality and identity behind these limitations. And it is only when the
limited ego is frustrated with its external expansion and clearly sees its own
bondages that the desire to realize its inner and fuller potential is aroused.
Here one truly sees the life of incessant self-concern, ambition, and
attachment as the illusion of Self. With the manifestation of Mahat or “I-
feeling” and intuition one can look down upon the fray and ask “who is it
that sees all of this?” There is a calm, quiescent eye in the storm of the
self and one begins to desire what it is and how to attain it. Endeavor is
quite simply the desire for the understanding of Tao, of dharma.
However, this movement is endeavor to realize and not realization itself.
The ego here assumes the qualities and identity necessary to live in
accordance with a deeper understanding and experience of existence. It is
not ensconsement and establishment in the intuitive life but the movement
toward that. Instead of the ego having an image of itself in accordance
with its external desires, it now manifests the qualities that help in its
psycho-spiritual orientation. Such qualities are necessarily ones that help
to understand, accept, and integrate the lower propensities into a more
refined self-concept. Such qualities are an acute awareness, non-judgment
of self and others, acceptance, compassion, moral conscience and an
adamant resolve to bring these qualities into expression.
While discussing this growth of self it is necessary to mention the 3 laws
that regulate the unfolding of higher propensities to incorporate and
compensate for the lower. These laws are recapitulation, transmutation,
and integration. It is clearly seen now how successive levels of
development grow through previous levels and that the vrttis at higher
vortexes are a similar though more refined expression of the lower vrttis.
The vrttis recapitulate themselves in successively higher modus operandi.
The mind isn’t entering entirely new form as it evolves to higher levels;
things are just restated in a more subtle way. For example, endeavor isn’t
impulsive like its predecessor, craving [at the Manipura], but both have to
do with mental expansion. Due to the fact that there are higher, more
conscious tendencies that correspond to more subtle levels of existence,
there is by necessity a transmutation of the energy used in the expression
of the lower as it moves toward the higher. Endeavor requires patience and
deep awareness, not forced and willful activity as in craving. Vrttis are
ingrained tendencies, mental instincts, that have evolved to serve an
evolutionary purpose and so there isn’t a rapid, immediate transition from
the old to the new. The new has to be born into being and the old will
continue to assert itself. This evolutionary shift in mental expression
therefore requires tremendous energy conversion. This process happens
unconsciously through an innate and expansive guiding faculty as well as
through the will and choice. One can decide to move along and follow one’s
inner voice that is leading the transmutation. If not, then there is always
trouble. A factor necessary for the successful transmutation of the higher
frequency of mental energy is integration. The old must be incorporated
into the new. That old expression of energy must be entirely directed into
the new faculty; otherwise the mind will be split in that there are now
opposing expressions of mind. This split may either to duplicity, a
regression to previous modes of behavior or a repression of the lower by
the higher. To use our previous example, the spiritually oriented personality
propelled by the endeavor vrtti may repress his ambitious tendencies from
his conscious awareness, but these old ambitious and willful tendencies still
have an energetic momentum to assert themselves unconsciously. He may
therefore express duplicity or hypocrisy by saying one thing and
unconsciously doing another. A similar psychological dissociation of the
lower from the higher was mentioned while discussing worry and will be
dealt with more when discussing the vrttis of vanity, selfishness, duplicity,
and argumentativeness as these tendencies reveal an incomplete
integration of lower vrttis into the self-reflective, intuitive, and
magnanimous potentialities of the Anahata.
This dissociation of the newly emerging tendencies from the old,
ingrained behavior patterns produces what classical psychology has termed
the shadow. The shadow doesn’t reside in one particular kosa, in other
words it is not a layer of mind. It is a defaulted mechanism of integration
from one mental-emotive level to the next. Whatever is not accepted and
integrated and therefore either repressed or suppressed is relegated into
the shadowy category of the “not me.” For example, if the mind doesn’t
have the vigor to make the jump from the Svadhistana (2 nd vortex) to the
Manipura (3rd vortex), then the entropic vrttis of the Svadhistana become
the shadow for the vigorous and ambitious mind that is trying to function at
the Manipura level. The entropy of the Svadhistana vrttis will complicate
and confound the autocratic Manipura vrttis. The externally driven
personality may suppress his/her tendencies that are associated with
insecurity and lack of confidence. In a similar manner, if the jump to the
Anahata from Manipura is not complete, as in our previous example, then
the vrttis or cluster of vrttis that constituted the former personality at the
Manipura become the shadow.
Affection
The affection of one sentient being for another as expressed through
this tendency at the Anahata is not one of an intense desire to consume
and possess another solely to gratify one’s own appetites. The quality of
interpersonal dialogue at the Anahata is a mutual, inter-subjective regard.
There is a love based on the deeply human qualities of another. It is not
completely selfless, however. Here there is still a desire to hold onto the
qualities of another because of the deep meaning (artha) that is given. This
form of attachment isn’t to satiate one’s hunger for external expansion but
is a fondness for the other based on the way that others affect them in a
deep and soulful way. With affection one’s heart is touched by another. The
inner qualities of another are loved by means of the deeper qualities of the
one who loves. In this dialogue the one who is loved is regarded for who
they really are on the inside and the lover exercises and discovers more of
his/her deeply human affective capacities.
Human love, whether intimate and romantic, familial, or brotherly has
such a tremendous hold over us that it both liberates our hearts from self-
enclosure while at the same time holds us only to those that we personally
love. Affection must be perfectly balanced in order to bring happiness,
otherwise it breeds suffering. It brings happiness when the regard we have
for others supersedes our own selfish wants and demands and thereby
propels us beyond self-interest. Affection always leads to obstacles when it
is exploited. This is done by placing the importance of the personal
meaning that it gives us and the demand to keep receiving it over the true
needs of others. In the words of William Blake, “Love seeketh not itself to
please, nor for itself hath any care. It gladly gives itself with ease and
creates a heaven in hell’s despair.”
Many love only to receive love and recognition from others without
giving much themselves. Only when affection reaches a functional synergy
or symbiosis where both the lover and the loved interchange roles freely,
both harmoniously giving and receiving, that a person can truly begin to
realize the higher function of love. Human love in all of its forms is an
intimation, an emerging expression of divine love. Love is the only seed of
spirituality. One who is loved feels worthy and whole, regarded and
respected. The one who loves sees the power of transformation upon
another by and from their own emotive forces within.
Once the person feels love-worthy by others a noble confidence and self-
respect, or respectful Self awareness is gained that permits one to love
freely, without fear, selfish demands and an imposing personal need. And
are not fear, selfishness, and our personal demands and insistence the
tendencies that reflect a lack of true confidence, Self awareness and self-
respect, and therefore, a lack of love? Only a strong and integrated mind
can truly love. At this level of personal integration one understands how
love is the essential element, the magic elixir for the growth of soul that
cures all of the fear, selfishness, and suffering in life. One sees how oneself
has been transformed by it and cant help but want to share it with others.
This is the culmination of personal love: to love without strings attached
and not to expect anything in return. Love ceases to be a mere feeling or
personal need but rather a spiritual principle with the deepest meaning and
power. When this stage is reached an even deeper and universal spiritual
love can begin to emerge. This more exalted tendency is at the Vishuddha
(5th vortex). Love and affection begins at the Anahata but reaches its fullest
expression at the Vishuddha. Here affection as artha (personal meaning) is
fully transformed into dharma (universal and essential meaning). In the
end there is but one Friend, in many colors and in many places, who moves
through infinite love behind all our faces.
Vanity
The order of the vortexes or vrttis of the microcosmic mind moves
from the subtle to the gross, or internal toward the external. The order of
the Sanskrit alphabet moves from the deeper vowels in the throat toward
sounds gradually made more forward in the mouth; from the guttural
toward the labial sounds. The alphabet, like the order of vrttis, starts with
the vowel sounds that are eternal and beyond time, and continuing with the
succession of consonants that move within time. “A” for example, can
sound constantly, without pulsation or pauses by the tounge, whereas a
consonant like “ga” or “ca” requires pauses and repetitions of the tongue.
Pulsation is the mark of time, the “mental measurement of the motivity of
action.” This is a very interesting example of how the internal, intuitive
macrocosmic order is mimicked and repeated in the physical body of the
microcosm.
These sound vortexes or matrices or “strings” are adaptations for the
mind to act according to various layers of density. They vibrate on certain
elemental planes whose end expression is always the manipulation of
matter via the physical body. These vortexes break through from these
higher energetic planes, explode in the microcosmic mind, and cause a
corresponding explosion in the body by moving the brain to fire off
hormones and neurotransmitters. Each sound vortex has its unique
purpose and function. From a spiritual perspective, we can categorize them
as pro-matter or pro-spirit. A vortex that is pro-matter will lock the mind
into the physical body with cruder thoughts and lower passions. Mental
energy is transmuted into physical expression. A pro-spirit vortex balances
the body chemistry in such a way that the mind and body are placid and
calm and capable of conceiving and feeling the workings of heaven, the
subtle planes of existence. This allows that the mind metamorphoses itself
finally into the original substance of Consciousness.
The Anahata Vortex is a balance of these inner and outer tendencies.
Half are “positive” and half are “negative”, or pro-spiritual and pro-
material. The negative tendencies lock the mind and body into egocentric
patterns of thinking and feeling. The lower nature is still not convinced of
its truer purpose in existence and still maintains and defends its separation,
its vanity. The positive tendencies take the sincere aspiring personality into
deeper levels of humanistic and eventually spiritual thinking and feeling.
The fifth vrtti of the Anahata Vortex vibrates with the sound “na”,
the guttural “na.” The various “n” sounds, the gutteral, the palatal, the
cerebral, and the dental “na” sounds are not paired with a “ha” sound, like
the consonants. They don’t go out, so to speak, and don’t need the
centripetal “ha” to bring it back. Instead, all of the “na” sounds refer to
certain generalized egocentric states of mind that generate from the
nucleus of the ego that is determined by and constituted of the rest of the
dual natured vortexes. To understand this point, the fifth vrtti of anahata,
the guttural “na”, controls the expression of self-regard, which is always to
varying degree an expression of self-love. When the expression is refined
and confident, it is a form of self-respect. When the person lacks
confidence, then it always tends toward vanity. Instead of being
expressions with a counter-balance like the other consonants, the “na”
sounds are more like generalized states or attitudes of the ego. The other
“na” sounds are also purely egocentric states of being like hypocrisy,
jealousy, and ambition, which correspond to the palatal, cerebral and
dental “na” sounds.
The repetitions of 4 consonants follwed by “na” continue throughout the
Anahata Vortex and down into the manipura (3rd vortex). This creates a
pattern of 1-2-3-4-”n”eutral-1234-”n”eutral…and so on. The rhythm
merges back into the “n”ucleus, and from the nucleus receives a new
impulse. This can also be described as a rhythm of centripetal centrifugal,
centripetal, centrifugal, neutral and so on. The ideas of the sounds of the
vrttis vibrating at certain tones with certain rhythmic patterns give scope
for deep speculation and investigation into the fundamental “music” of the
universe and how perhaps our human aesthetics may mirror this
fundamental, harmonious order.
VANITY
It is now clear that the mind and personality affected by the propensities
of the Anahata Vortex are deeply self-conscious, ideational tendencies that
lead the person to a more abstract but congruent self-concept. The self-
concept at the anahata level isn’t so much defined by the physical body, its
urges, and the grosser elements of its environment. The mind and
personality is abstracted from these levels and its focus is more mental and
ideational. The personality is informed by the deep and abstracted
thoughts of “who am I essentially, unconditioned by my environment?”, or
“what do I truly feel.”
Vanity represents the self-centered triumph of the individual over the
outward pull of the social environment. The social environment demands
conformity and a submission of the self to the collective. The process of
individuation, contrarily, is the discovery of the true identity of the person.
This represents the endeavor of the individual to overcome the fear of its
own social alienation as well as the social censorship for moving away from
the dominant social paradigms that have conditioned the emerging,
evolving self into limited self-concepts and narrow social boundaries. This
process is natural and healthy in the evolution of mind back toward Spirit; it
seeks the unbounded knowledge, being and bliss of its essential,
unconditioned, and uncreated essence. Vanity, however, represents the
incomplete and partial process of individuation. Vanity looks back on its
growth and achievements out the entropic pull of conformity, insecurity,
shame and weakness with a sense of self-satisfaction and proud
accomplishment.
Instead of finding its grounding in pure Spirit or in its dynamic
relationship to Spirit, the ego secures a niche for itself in its own qualities,
abilities, achievements, and self-referential words and symbols. In other
words, the ego proudly identifies only with the objective, relative, and ever-
changing qualities that color and qualify the pure feeling of I instead of the
“pure and eternal I” itself. However, vanity does not imply the bounded
identity of the ego with its own qualities. Qualification and bondage of the I
doesn’t necessarily mean pride and vanity. Instead, vanity is the
aggrandizement and exclusive identification of the ego with its own
qualities. The process of the whole evolving through the part, or the
Macrocosm becoming through the microcosm, is ignored. The ego sees its
objective qualities and proud accomplishments as its subjectivity, as its
fundamental identity. It is more than the confusion of the subject with the
object however, as the sense of doership (ego or Aham) is alienated and
encapsulated from the rest of the mental being.
Here the ego doesn’t recognize its full mental, psychological makeup
and gives no regard to the subtle evolutionary forces trying to express and
manifest themselves through the individual. The individual instead sees its
own ego as the origin and be all and end all of existence, “I am the center
of the universe”. The true self is pure, unconditioned, and free. Shakti’s
gunas generate all of the qualities for that Subject. With vanity there is the
confusion of the subject with objective qualities. The I qualified and
intermingling by objective qualities is mistaken as the hub of the identity.
There is no wonder that vanity and pride are universally considered the
greatest error and flaw possible for humans. The Macrocosmic process of
evolution and becoming through the microcosm is usurped by the limited
ego with its claim to the authorship of this process.
A fact that many people don’t realize is that vanity is a weakness. Its
easy for one to mistaken see how accomplished people with vanity are
actually strong and fearless people. However, if one looks deeper into the
dynamics and origins of vanity one will clearly understand that vanity is a
compensation for uncertainty and fear and a home for ambition and
compulsion. In other words vanity represents the qualification of a more
intelligent and conscious mind by the unresolved complexes associated
with the vrttis of the svadhistana(2nd vortex) and manipura (3rd vortex)
propensities. The conflict of the doubt, shame, and fear with the ambition,
blind attachment, and lust for achievement on the battleground of the
manipura seeks a shelter in a higher and intelligent form of awareness at
the anahata. Vanity aids in the compensation and assuagement of this
conflict by putting one’s psychic energy into higher qualities and
components of the self. A more abstract notion of self-recognition emerges
as the glory of the internal ego with its self-reflective ideas of itself are
embellished. Here the identification with one’s own psyche becomes the
channel for the psychic energy or the momentum and inspiration of the
mind. The ego may still qualify itself with its external achievements, but it
is the internalization of these achievements by an abstracted identity
separated from its environment that gets the focus of awareness.
The liberation of the identity from the body and environment is the
summum bonum of human life if the process is carried through to
completion without creating separation. Most of us are somewhere in-
between; realizing that we have a transcendent identity separated from
world and body but are still contradictorily associating this abstract notion
of “I” with the objective qualities of world and body, and are therefore
bound to the imaginary notions of “me and mine.”
The Dynamic of “Ca” and “Cha” in Discernment and Depression
In the phase of involution, Shiva, the infinite consciousness, has been
transformed by his immortal consort Shakti, the divine creative energy, into
all that is in this universe. It is Shiva itself that has become “star stuff.”
The microcosm is a creation made on the return journey, where star-
light and matter are yearning to evolve beyond physicality, into pure
energy, into mind, and finally back again into Consciousness. Therefore,
the microcosmic mind is fundamentally dominated by the centripetal,
return, or evolutionary force. “Ha” is the sound of this primordial
centripetal energy of mind. It is the first vrtti, or vortex of the mind, which
is pure subjective awareness. “Ha” pertains to the Ajina Vortex. Here the
mind misteriously conceives only the inconceivable Atman who is entirely
beyond the mind itself. The mind “conceives” this truth in understanding
that “I am That”; “I am Consciousness itself, and not this mind.” It is the
only tendency of mind that goes entirely into transcendence, into the pure
subjectivity of Shiva. Even the noble Vishuddha tendencies relate to the
external world in a spirit of service and chivalry, but “Ha” is a force of mind,
of Shakti, that surrenders itself only to Shiva. Its comforting to know that it
is the only force that can entirely dominate the mind and unify it in the
infinite abode of Shiva. The universe conspires against our external
desires. It is only here that all desires find their fulfillment. All of the other
49 major vrttis go outward. “Ha” is the only tendency that psorax can’t
touch. The very existence of the parasite who feeds on unconsciousness
depends on your not going back to the One, of your inability to transmute
your little “I”, the ego, into the great “I-Witness.” Therefore, only
surrendering to the infinite Atman will bring an end to psorax’s dominion.
Only the entity who stands beyond good and evil can liberate one from
good and evil.
While incarnated in human form and passing through the soul-building
experiences of this world we must know and cultivate the positive
propensities of mind that help us to expand and adapt to this relative world
while never forgetting that our true home is in the spirit. We must discern
between the relative and the absolute, between finite and infinite. The
world isn’t inherently corrupt, we just haven’t properly learned how to
handle ourselves. We haven’t learned to economize the infinite nature of
desire.
Discernment is the sixth propensity of the Anahata Vortex. It is
administrated by the sound “ca.” Discernment is conscience, the force of
Consciousness over the mind. Mind harmonizes with the sublime,
transcendental consciousness and lives and acts according to its inner way.
The inner path can only become pure when we really know the difference
between what liberates us and what does not- that which causes suffering
and delusion. Desire is tamed only through the realization that it always
brings some form of suffering in the end. The only desire that truly
liberates is the desire to become one with the Infinite. It is only when a soul
has struggled and wrestled and developed its discernment that the
instinctual nature of external desires begin to lose their grip on the mind.
The finite can never satiate the infinite. External desires can never bring
nirvana. Striving after this liberation doesn’t mean giving up the world
entirely, but a seeker must have the eyes open so as to properly navigate
through maya. With the development of discernment, temptations may
come more to test you, but finally help to establish one in a deeper
understanding in which renunciation truly becomes sweet and not
something forced and manipulated.
Not understanding this essential truth of existence always brings
emptiness, existential ennui. This is the 7th vrtti of the Anahata Vortex,
psychic depression, controlled by the sound “cha.” “Ha” must descend to
“ca” to return the undiscerning mind back into equilibrium. Hopefully, a
little “dark night of the soul” will do the trick, but many fall so deep into
emptiness and accept all that psorax is offering. Psorax loves an empty,
bored ego and will always find ways to fill you. “An idle mind is the devil’s
workshop.” The greater the image that one invests in the separate ego the
greater the shadow cast upon the mind by the infinite radiance of
consciousness. We don’t understand that it is our own shadow cast by an
inflated vain image that traps us in this maya. If there is a place for an
image in this eternal mind storm of vrttis, then I imagine that is should be
as light, honest and transparent as possible. The dark schemes of the
unconscious ego can’t hide too well in this discerning light.
Discernment
As previously mentioned the Anahata level of mind is the fulcrum on
which rests the directional flow of mind. If the Svadhistana and Manipura
propensities qualify the Anahata propensities one may get an intellectually
developed mind with a definite and abstract sense of separateness lacking
warmth and moral conscience. This aloof coolness is due to the fact that
the intellect and abstract, self-concept is still preoccupied with the self-
establishing propensities of the Svadhistana Vortex and/or the self-
acquisitional propensities of the Manipura. The ability of a heightened
consciousness and personality with a potentially deep, inner life and
capacity to think and feel deeply is in this state unable to use this
consciousness to relate with others in correspondingly deeper ways. The
drives of the lower vrttis usurp the intelligence of the higher.
The propensity of conscience or discernment informs the mind with the
ability to use its reason to determine what choices and modes of being lead
toward the growth and expansion of the inner life in relation to Spirit as well
as world. It can also discern what actions lead toward the confinement of
self-centeredness and psychological stagnancy. With conscience the mind
can understand its potential for self-centeredness while at the same time be
in touch with the intuitive ideas that guide the mind out of its limitations
and towards spiritual realization.
Discernment, the ability to know what is good and just, is a propensity
that is rooted in the Intuitive Mind. Having a deep, intuitive ability to
understand and peer into the nature of the self and the world enables one
to act in accordance with truth. The intuitive conscience spoken of here is
the essential conscience, the conscience as Consciousness; it is the
representative of Spirit within the mind. Discernment, or viveka, is not the
external, conventionally imposed script of do’s and don’ts, but the inner
voice and benevolent guidance of the eternal Tao. The higher order of
harmony in the Tao, or Cosmic Mind, is intuitively understood by the Aham
at the Anahata. These subtle laws are translated into microcosmic
existence and harmonized with humane sentiment and discerning wisdom. .
The principles of Yama and Niyama serve as guidelines to develop this
natural, moral conscience that is guided by the Intuitive Mind.
Depression
There are 3 main degrees of depression that can be experienced. The
propensity of psychic stupor at the 2nd vortex is of course the heaviest. It
represents a crippling of the entire psychological foundation. With
melancholy at the 3rd vortex there is an entropy of the dynamic,
extroverted propensities that link the phenomenal self with its world. The
vrtti of emptiness at the fourth vortex is, as the name implies, a mental
depression in which the conscious ego experiences ennui, boredom, lack of
meaning, and dispiritedness. It is more of a psychic and existential malady
as opposed to a mere crippling of the drives and instincts that characterize
melancholy and psychic stupor.
The Aham, or ego, feels empty not just because the world is not in
harmony with the psyche but the psyche is not in harmony with itself. The
Anahata Vortex is concerned with the deep meaning of the phenomenal
identity, of what the true nature of the personality is. Psychic depression
results when these existential needs are not fulfilled or realized. There is
only an empty, inner space. Nothing connects and integrates the self
definition with itself as well as to other selves and society.
Essentially, this type of depression ensues when the ego is not in
harmony with its conscience, the deeply intuitive ideas that link all
elements of the personality together and give it inspiration and direction.
Conscience is the guiding spirit within mind. It shows us what is virtuous
and how to align ourselves with the spirit of benevolence or Dharma at any
given moment and in any situation.
The flow and dynamics of mental life is not a chaos but a very refined
order. It is only when the ego resists this intuitive order that one can
become confused, alienated, enervated, and eventually depressed.
Depression, especially when experienced existentially at the Anahata, has
its own meaning and order. It is in fact a wake-up call to be more
conscious of what we are and how we should be. In many cases depression
manifests in periods of great transformation. “Before preparing a man for
great things, heaven first fills him full of bitterness and despair,” a Taoist
friend once said. Perhaps depression, at least when viewed spiritually, can
serve the purpose of making us more real, more aligned with our inner
selves. The duplicity and incongruities within the personality are
undermined and disabled from further perpetuation. So often the ego
invests itself in socially constructed and uncreative images, in a superficial
conformity to a conventional system, or just never explores or listens to its
own inner voice that is always calling for expansion and transformation.
Psychic depression can root out the subtle forms of egotism and vanity
in even the most spiritual of minds. St. John of the Cross termed this type
of dispiritedness the “Dark Night of the Soul.” It appears as a contraction
and dulling of the mental faculties but underneath there is a spiritual
process occurring that is helping a soul move beyond all of the limitations
and boundaries that keep it confined to its separateness and self-enclosure.
And with psychic depression there is the ability to ruminate over why one
feels heavy and lacks meaning, why things are just not going right, and to
thereby find solutions. Our inner lives are never haphazard and
meaningless. Life is a constant process of becoming. Each and every
situation is an opportunity for growth-to exercise our discriminative
intellect, insight and humane compassion. Within us always is conscience,
the voice of Spirit, incessantly guiding and directing our lives for our
greatest good. We need only to listen to and be true to ourselves.
The Dynamics of “Ja” and “Jha” in Self and Selfishness
With the seventh vrtti of the spiritual heart, we move into the right, solar
side of the Anahata Vortex. Here the centrifugal force is stronger than the
centripetal force and the tendencies on this side move more outward than
inward. The seventh vrtti is the need for self-definition or “Aham vrtti”.
Aham is ego or “doer-I”. Aham really doesn’t denote egotism or selfishness,
which is in fact the eigth vrtti. I call Aham “self-definition” because it is
simply the need to understand yourself in the relative plane of existence;
who you are, who you have been and who you want to do in this life. It
cannot be a negative tendency because the human mind propelled by this
vrtti always desires clarity, expansion and betterment of its existential
position. In fact, this tendency can take one so deep into the question of
“who am I?” that the very separateness of the ego-dominated “I”
disappears into the eternal “I-Witness”. To follow this vrtti to its origin takes
one back to the headwaters of the godhead where it pours itself out into
every microcosmic soul. The Aham is the active, doer-I; but just behind it is
the I-witness that is perfectly still, eternal, and simple. Where does one
begin and the other end? It is just like trying to find the edge of a shadow in
that there is no real, defined limit. The ego in its most noble expression is
but a relative vehicle for the super-personal Consciousness to express itself
as a person, as a Self-realized human being. And it becomes so, or will
become so in every microcosm. When one truly trusts oneself, then the
person is sustained by the I-Witness itself. To simply remember and ideate
on the Witnessing Entity behind your person will always put the mind into
balance and all problems are placed in a clearer perspective. The person is
but an ornamentation, an unintentional flash whose image is illuminated
from an image-less act from deep within one’s inner Subjectivity. This
expression is controlled by the vibrant and buoyant acoustic root of “ja.”
The degeneration of this manifestation of the Macrocosm in the
microcosm is egotism or selfishness. It is controlled by the sound “jha.”
Here is where a temple to the separate, fearful and vain ego is built and
worshiped by the vrttis below the Anahata Vortex. The egocentric and vain
desires coupled by the unconscious emotional complexes take refuge in an
embellished image of oneself. Where selfishness reigns, death is not far
away. The underlying reason for our crisis of consciousness, culture and
self-definition is not just the natural limitations of evolving beings but the
enforcement of this vrtti by our society and its institutions. Instead of
fostering a sense of inter-being and cooperation, most of us have learned
individual separateness, competition and domination. Within a capitalist
and individualist society there is space for just a few “winners” while so
many suffer from a lack of personal fulfillment and social alienation that
leaves them spiritually estranged and neurotic. I was born in probably one
of the most neurotic and mentally ill societies on the planet, at least for the
so-called developed world. Now, in the north of Mexico, I see that most
people want to have a typical American life-style and that these
materialistic, individualistic values only further corrupt what is already quite
a troubled culture.
One can carry this selfishness over into one’s spiritual practice as well
and selfishly seek enlightenment. One who truly knows the Atman also
loves from this sublime stance. I have seen many who devote long hours to
meditation and/or yoga but really make no progress because they think
only of themselves and their spiritual image. In fact, they create much
imbalance in their lives and fail to see how they only begin to suffer more
than when they were just mundane people. As an Upanishad states, “those
that seek only the finite go into darkness. Those who seek only the infinite
go into deeper darkness.” Yoga is the balance of adjusting the internal and
external mental flows and making them one. One really needs a fairly
balanced mind before beginning spiritual practice. Unfortunately, yoga, and
especially Tantra Yoga, is not a form of psychotherapy designed to cure
modern psychological complexes. Rather, it is a form of pinnacled, “apex
psychology” designed to help well-adjusted people attain spiritual
realization.
For those not so well-adjusted, a clear, psychological understanding of
yama and niyama coupled with gentle asanas and meditation is necessary
before attempting any other practices. If one looks at the world of yoga, it is
mostly an ego show and there are very few who really understand the
implications of what they are teaching. Many are just asana clowns, but it
gets even more dangerous the higher one goes up the ashtaunga (8-
limbed) ladder. I lived in a monastic community with many Tantra Yoga
practitioners. Although there were some very good examples of mature
meditators, there were also so many who were often quite neurotic because
they couldn’t digest all of the unconscious and sub-conscious psychic
content that their practices were awakening. Instead of finding
enlightenment, one only ends up deeper in the quagmire of an ignorant ego
besieged by so many emotional complexes. They probably would have been
better off with families and a less intense spiritual practice.
For the ego that contemplates and surrenders to the inner radiance of
pure awareness, selfishness becomes something aversive. Selfishness is
revelry in the ignorance of separateness. It is born of suffering and dies in
suffering. The individual who truly understands his/her inner self will always
contribute something good to the collective well-being. Through the
contemplation and devotion to the pure “I” beyond thought and volition,
one can’t help but find oneself in all persons.
Ego, Self-Identity
Aham-vrtti does not refer to egotism or the vrtti of vanity. Instead, this
propensity is the feeling of one’s actual identity. It is the existential concept
of what one’s psychological make-up consists of, independent of inferiority
or superiority complexes, of what the essential nature of the personality is.
It informs one of what are the innate proclivities; one’s cognitive styles and
affective tones, whether one is introverted or extroverted, a thinker or a
feeler, analytical or intuitive, etc..
This self-concept is a notion of identity that organizes and structures the
various propensities and modes of thought into an organized concept of a
general identity. Ego vrtti gives a thought-form to the notion of “I”.
Although the “I” or Mahat is clearly manifest at the Anahata Vortex, it is
still qualified by phenomenal reality. The reality of the ego here is mental
and psycho-spiritual. Ego, therefore, is a concept of what the “I” is in
relation to the relative world.
Deep and wondrous potentials are possible with this vrtti. The human
notion of the “I” is most often bound into sociological, national, cultural, and
regional as well as the limited notions of the lower personality. However, a
great potential resides in this vrtti in that the eternal spiritual identity,
Shiva, can find an abode of expression through the human personality.
There is truly only one Aham in the universe, and it belongs to the
Macrocosmic Mind. Only through association of the Macrocosmic Aham
with the microcosmic chitta does the Aham feel that it belongs to the
physical body and psychological identity. Maya, ultimately, is but a trick of
the senses and the Aham who identifies with their relative reality.
While it is true that the human personality is something relative as it is
within the domain of Shakti, there is, however, the reflection of the
fundamental consciousness that informs the notion of identity. At this stage
of the cultivation of the spiritual personality the objective qualities and
concepts that qualify the Identity are not so much a bondage but rather a
means of expression in which the ineffable Infinite Being expresses itself
through the finite personality. The objective qualities are transparent in
that the personality no longer clings to outer, conditioned notions for self-
reference. Here one understands that the infinite Brahma, in itself, is not a
personality with any qualities. It expresses itself through the finer, subtler
realms of the relative, created world. Personality or character cannot exist
for the Infinite without the limitations of finite definitions. Conversely,
personality cannot exist in the finite without the reflection of the subjective,
existential feeling of I, which is Infinite. Character, therefore, is the
breeding ground of the Infinite to express itself consciously through a finite
medium. Of course all of creation is the progeny of Shiva, but it is within
the developed human being that self-consciousness knows itself
fundamentally as Supreme Consciousness, even though there still may be
subtle qualifications of that Consciousness. But without those subtle
qualifications, the Infinite would not have a personality.
All human beings are gods in disguise. Only one who treads the deepest
ground of their being and identity realizes that their life, their being, and
relative existence is in truth a vehicle for Shiva to manifest itself in
multitudinous forms of personality. The infinite gives a name to the
nameless. This is perhaps the sweetest and melodious truth of human life:
that human life is verily the Life Divine.
Egoism, Selfishness
While all of the vrttis of the Anahata Vortex are related to the concept of
self, half of them bind the identity to the limitations of self while the other
half, the positive qualities, provide an impetus for the expansion of the
phenomenal self. With vanity there is an embellishment and pride with the
qualities that one identifies with in an attempt to establish one’s existential
identity. The vrtti of selfishness is similar with its fixation on the qualities of
the limited identity. However, with this tendency there is even more of a
sharp and guarded egocentrism than with vanity.
Vanity is a limitation, but at the same time gives one a sense of pride
and confidence with a belief in their self-efficacy. One can have a healthy
personality with good qualities but still hold onto a little pride. Selfishness
is more of a pathology in that the personality is lacking of true and
meaningful qualities and instead of endeavoring to expand in soulful and
meaningful ways, it fixes ones psychic energy exclusively on preserving the
notion of self. A proud person can at times step outside of their boundaries
and connect with others. This is more difficult for the selfish in that their
self-concern and importance is not just to polish off and refine the
personality. Rather it is a defense that helps to hold together the integrity
of a weak ego structure.
Very often this vrtti is found to work in accordance with the vrttis of the
second vortex. Resentment, compulsion, repression (of the 2nd vortex) are
all propensities that hold together the integrity of the ego’s foundation. If
the ego isn’t well integrated and the 3rd and 4th vortex vrttis haven’t
integrated and compensated for the second vortex, then the 4th vortex
personality will be very contracted. The potential for psychic expansion at
the Anahata Vortex will be concentrated on the security of a fragile self-
concept that is perpetually insecure. The character of such a person is
often aloof, distrustful, and vacillates between a constrained emotional
detachment and a repression of infantile tendencies and a compulsion to
act upon them. One also maintains a very marked self-other boundary that
keeps others at a safe distance.
Duplicity
If there ever were a favorite hiding place for psorax in the human mind,
it must be in the vortex or vrtti of duplicity. Recall that psorax is the term
that Pluma Blanca referred to as the centripetal or return force in the
universe that always pushes back against and apparently punishes
microcosmic, outward actions that are not in harmony with the original,
balanced actions of the Macrocosm. This outward, frustrated projection
remains lodged in one’s mental and physical body in the form of a reaction
like a constant itch under the skin, or something much, much worse. Every
previous mental action still weighs and acts upon the mind in the present.
Only in the spiritually ignorant microcosmic mind is there a need for this act
of compensation to put the universe back into order after distorting it with
an impulsive will. Is psorax really evil? It just pretends to be the bad guy to
reflect our own shadow. Behind everything in this phenomenal world exists
an underlying love.
With duplicity the mind has evolved what seems to be an efficient
mechanism of allowing 2 contrary systems to function side by side without
any contradiction, or so it seems. The “raging bundle of desire in a dying
animal” and the sincere, responsible, conscious human being incarnate in
the same being. Hermann Hesse’s Steppenwolf comes to mind here.
Duplicity acts as a form of repression and distortion of what really is true
about our lives in the more shadowy area while at the same time giving free
reign to the wolf inside without compunction or pangs of conscience. In
short, duplicity is a lie. It is an attempt to save face, to not admit that one is
governed by the shadow.
The shadow, and therefore psorax, is everywhere humans are; in
individuals and the collective. The grossest examples exist common society,
in our daily conventions, and especially religion and politics. The imperialist
governments create their own enemies or “terrorists”. They themselves
promote, manipulate or even create corrupt foreign regimes who prostitute
their natural resources and human labor to the powerful nations. They will
never hesitate to make the most absurd lies so as to wage war and kill
millions to steal the natural wealth from the rest of the world. The average
citizens go along with it and wave their flags and get fat while unwitting
soldiers and private security forces and other drones go off to other lands to
kill people and bring their “demonocracy” to all. Where does psorax fit into
all of this? What kind of shadow is created from an individual that believes
these lies and what kind of greater monster is created by a collective body
that goes along with the myth? Even greater and darker is the shadow of
the shrewd people that fabricate these false realities for their own benefit.
The reactions from these actions are all so apparent in the collective
depression, neurosis and zombification of the common people who have
little notion of or feel helpless to the false realities of their lives. A life
unconnected to the subterranean flow of unity consciousness will always be
compensated by cosmic law; the grosser the transgression, the grosser the
reaction.
Whenever the personality makes a jump from one kosa to the next there
is of necessity a shift of psychic energy as well as the objectives of that
psychic energy. A healthy evolutionary leap from one kosa to the next
would gradually incorporate the lower tendencies into the higher. As we
have seen there is a recapitulation of prior tendencies in successively
subtler forms. If the old patterns of expression is not transmuted and
integrated into the new, then a split within the personality occurs. The
lower tendencies exist and function at the same time as the higher. And
because there is a great difference in thematic structure at each mental
level, there are therefore very definite incongruities in such a personality.
What was once the major them of a particular vortex becomes the
unconscious shadow of the next higher vortex. For example, the
propensities of the 3rd vortex that were not incorporated into the Anahata
level of personality become the shadow for that personality.
The tendency of duplicity or hypocrisy manifests itself when the
Anahata-intelligence of the personality is unable to fully integrate the lower,
now unconscious propensities, of the vortexes preceding it. Instead of the
Anahata Vortex being able to transmute the psychic energy of the lower
propensities into one of its own, the mind at this level tries to mask, deny,
distort, or suppress these incongruent tendencies. Here we may have the
case of a personality endowed with some finer, conscious qualities and
intelligence; for example a little moral conscience, a warm affection for
others, as well as a spiritual outlook on life. This same personality,
however, still contains remnants of a previous pattern of mental functioning
that run contrary to the current sense of being. Instead of consciously
recognizing and working to integrate these disparate tendencies into a
harmonious and conscious synthesis the mind can use its cognitive abilities
to distort and mask these contrary tendencies and thereby permit them to
exist side by side with the conscious personality or ego. Different
environments will bring out these different, opposing tendencies. In one
environment one may behave in an uninhibited manner, expressing what is
normally unexpressed, while in another one may act according to social
protocol. What is meant here is not the expression of different facets of the
personality that actually accord to a current situation. Instead duplicity is
the act of covering up, putting up a show or “persona” to cover up an
undesirable inner reality.
This mixing of antithetical positions within the same mind causes the
cognition to cover both fields, “to hunt with the hounds as well as run with
the hares.” At one time the assertions, compulsions, hatred, etc. can assert
itself. At another time one is kind and fair. Duplicity is when the kind and
fair side refuses to really recognize its shadowy counterpart. Or perhaps its
the stable side of the personality with its seemingly confident sense of
identity that distorts or denies a weak and insecure part of the personality.
Duplicity can manifest itself in various ways. What is central to this
tendency is that it is an attempt at keeping two antithetical forces from
clashing with each other. At the same time this tendency is a block to
integration and wholeness that is possible at the Anahata Vortex.
Duplicity manifests as hypocrisy when the more intelligent part of the
being recognizes its inferior parts but attempts to compensate for them by
setting up higher standards that cannot possibly be met by a dual and
divided mind. For example, such a person may express may express crude
and lewd behavior in the company of his friends, but denounce that same
behavior while at work or church in order to uphold a persona of social
respectability.
Duplicity is all too easily found in religious groups where insecure people
have the need for others to guide or influence them spiritually. Without
even mentioning sexual deviance, there is still a mountain of dangerous
examples of duplicity in religion. Duplicity allows hidden tendencies to
burrow deep into these minds while the “demons” of spiritual vanity and
the desire to manipulate and control others become the primary objective.
Once good intentionality has degenerated, what virtue is left to protect one
from the darkest parts of the shadow? Its the same situation whether they
wear white collars or orange robes or rattle off scriptural sayings in Latin or
Sanskrit: people that deceive and harm others spiritually through their
hypocrisy have very hard falls into perversion. What was repressed and
hidden becomes so painfully evident after a fall. Spiritually-minded people
with discernment, or viveka, cannot tolerate these activities and belong to
any groups that lie and cover up these truths. A spiritually conscious person
either has to get out of the web of lies or become an agitator or
revolutionary, a “heretic.” Insight must extend beyond the names and
forms of religion. “It is alright to be born into a sect, but not to die in one”,
said Vivekananda.
It is natural to have duality in human existence. Sometimes we are
strong and other times we are weak and cannot resist negative tendencies.
There is so much uncertainty in deeper existential matters and values.
Duplicity, however, is when the mind censors and covers up the
inconvenient truths by fractioning off and compartmentalizing the
personality into a false image. This image is untrue in that it is an
argumentation against another, undesirable part of one’s being. One
declares war upon oneself. Natural duality and indecision take on a
distorted belief system about oneself where only one side of the dual
equation is true. The more one represses and distorts the shadow, the more
of a “true believer” one becomes. Fanaticism and a lot of argumentation is
needed to quell the shadow. It takes a lot of internal psychological work
and/or spiritual practice to integrate the disparate parts of the personality
and become whole. And this is only possible with a very positive view of
existence that permits the shadow to dissolve in this light little by little.
Instead of becoming whole and congruent, duplicity loves to project its
inner, repressed tensions of conscience onto some “other”. Instead of
seeing what is vile and low inside oneself it is much easier to find a scape-
goat outside of oneself. Be careful entering into the shadow area of another,
whether it is an individual or a collective society. Projections of the shadow
are the perfect medium to transfer one’s own dark side onto another. The
“other”, the “enemy” may turn out to be the revealer of truth, however. It
may be your best friend in that one can really begin to understand this
unconscious game of shadow projection that has the whole world going
insane.
The most subtle expression of duplicity is the recognition of the fact that
there is only one, integral consciousness in the universe but I still can’t let
go of my ego with its projections of name and form onto the supreme
unspeakable reality. Following a particular religion or path is an ephemeral
reality of ego that deep inside I know is quite relative and very limited but
always seems to stick to me and convince me of its reality. There is also the
fear that Jesus, Baba, or whomever is one’s guru will punish one for letting
go of the name and form and approaching the nameless godhead. The
formless god says “no more of this” and unifies you with the Om that is
beyond but vibrates every particle of this universe! Om will always drown
out your little words for god. Only a direct, unmediated understanding of
Oneself destroys all religious belief and dogma.
The complete purification of this vrtti of duplicity purifies the right, solar
side of the Anahata Vortex and allows one to contemplate the pure “I” at its
seat in the human spiritual heart. Without this vortex of duplicity vibrating
and bifurcating the right side of the anahata, the vedantic sages
contemplated the pure Self in the right side of the chest where it radiates
outward in innocence and purity.
After duplicity there are two more vrttis in the anahata, argumentation and
repentance. One can keep up the act, the duplicitous war of soul attrition, a
little longer with the ammo of argumentation or put an end to it with a deep
feeling of regret or repentance and change course toward what is
eventually complete surrender of the ego.
The Dynamics of “Ta” and “Tha” in Argumentation and Repentance
The Anahata is the moral battleground in the war of dharma. Dharma
means the true essence of something independent of our varied
interpretations of it, the thing-in-itself. In this case dharma refers to human
nature. We can see in the Anahata that there are innate and humane
tendencies that seek to direct the mind toward subtlety and universal
humanism (hope, expansion, conscience), but at the same time there
evolve these abstract, egocentric protection mechanisms that keep the
person bound into limited thought and feeling (worry, vanity, egoism,
duplicity). If the Anahata is aligned more with a true sense of self rather
than a vain sense of egoism, then the Anahata expands and the person
becomes more spiritually oriented. However, this effort to expand towards
spirit is something new for the materialistic mind. The good conscience of
human beings is all too easily corrupted by bad ideology and social
conventions. Instead of being fostered and enforced by our social
institutions it is often suppressed or distorted. For example, so many
Americans feel pain and sympathy when they see images of dead Iraquis or
Afghanis, but their conditioned national sentiments never let them truly go
against the grain and transcend these superficial, imposed ideas. Most
people find ways to justify even these actions in order to hold on to some
sense of pride in their collective identity. Argumentation is a form of
cognitive dissonance in which the intellect identifies with the false form of
conscience and argues against their true moral conscience. In this
example, the conscience takes the side of “God Bless America” instead of
the more intuitive conscience that says “this is all a lie.”
“Ta” is the sound vortex behind the propensity of argumentation.
Because it is a movement against true conscience, it is always doomed to
fail. Pure justice or dharma doesn’t require the arguments of the ego and is
a higher tendency in the Vishuddha. This noble concern for universal
welfare is backed by dharma, which is the balance of consciousness and
action, of Shiva and Shakti. However, argumentation in the Anahata always
has a shadow, and therefore a weakness. “Tha” is the sound of the return
of the weakened force of argumentation that wants to come back to center,
in alignment with true conscience and dharma. One desires to be whole
again after having become fragmented by so many argumentations and
false stories of self. “Tha” manifests the propensity of repentance. One
truly has suffered and perhaps made others suffer. The only way out of this
suffering is to become more aware, take responsibility and make some
major decisions. Only in this manner will the separate, willful, and
egocentric mind ever abandon its arguments and justifications for its baser
tendencies.
Argumentation
The next to last vrtti of the Anahata Vortex is argumentation. In general,
argumentation is a way for the ego to defend itself against uncertainty by
summoning up reasons and arguments to convince others or oneself of
being right. We convince others through verbal argument, we convince
ourselves through mental argument, through our inner thought conflicts. So
often, when one argues with another in an effort to convince, one is really
only unconsciously trying to preserve the projections of the mind from
falling into doubt and uncertainty. The separate ego always needs to think
that its position as center of its universe is secure.
It is all too easy for the argumentative mind to fall into lower
propensities like hatred, ambition, fear, shame, lack of confidence and so
on. An offended ego can even come to blows with another.
Since argumentation is a reaction to our own inferior, unaccepted and
rejected parts of ourselves like shame and guilt, human beings want to
project this discomfort onto somebody or something else as a psychic
purge. The people who are really like us in our most hidden ways are the
people who are most threatening and should be judged accordingly. When
we make judgments against others we not only condemn them but our own
shadowy parts as well. And so with this form of argumentation and
judgment we create a rift and boundary between self and others and also
between self and other parts of self.
From a spiritual perspective one sees argumentation as an attempt to
defends one’s projections of how the ego fits into its personal, social, and
spiritual realities. Normally, a person is not very secure within. Our beliefs
are adopted from others or we anxiously or unconsciously cling to some
“ideology” to secure our footing in reality. It is this very weakness in lack of
true awareness that creates the need for argumentation. Behind most
ideologies is fear and insecurity and the ideology attempts to assuage this
tension. We often believe in something or someone out of ignorance,
desperation, laziness, or superficial conformity. It is important to realize
these parts of our personal “ideology” so we don’t fall into complacency and
one-sidedness.
In the deeper sense argumentation is indecision. “Is this morally
correct?, am I really living to my full capacity?, am I in harmony with my
universe?” It is quite natural and even useful in the expansion of the mind if
indecision is not carried to far. All realizations are a result of clash and
cohesion. When argumentation internalizes it begins to touch a truer
reason, balanced with intuition and compassion in the spiritual heart. Here
the mind is safe and secure and can finally begin to use the discerning
intellect to ask the right questions. The mind begins to ask, “Who, which
part of me, is thinking this and with what motive and intention?” Through
this discernment and self-knowledge we eventually learn to simply let the
Witness into the thoughts and feelings, to let it purify them. This
spontaneously and unintentionally changes the mind by internalizing the
thoughts. If a photon is changed by our expected perception of it being a
particle or a wave, then just imagine how would our thoughts and feelings
and even our entire mind is changed by simply being witnessed by the
Supreme Consciousness within. To surrender the mind into the sublime
silence of the Witness creates a reverberation of grace as an echo from this
silence. All mental distortions and problems, no matter how great, may be
straitened out by making the mind parallel with the Witness, by becoming
one with my source.
How can one be centered in the Witness when the mind is so confused,
split, and unconscious of itself? Unifying the mind with the essence of
awareness makes the mind full of this awareness and purifies all the little
dark, hidden caves for psorax. By relating with the most subtle entity the
mind begins to mimic that entity, instead of the shadow. Mind always wants
to merge into Shiva, into Consciousness. This is its fundamental attraction.
Only by going seeing beyond the mind can we truly see the mind. Mind is
not the fundamental being; it is not the Witness, but is being witnessed.
One can see one’s whole life, past present, and future merging into an
Eternal Now from this perspective. Rilke asked, “Who really lives this life
anyhow, is it you God?” The mind is known to the Witness as its own little
self, a little wave on its own ocean, a self-becoming progeny being
constantly and eternally born out of its Infinite being.
Repentance
My friends once asked me why I didn’t get angry with a mechanic who
once took my engine out, apparently reinstalled it by putting everything in
its place but only tightened the nuts and bolts with his fingers. I say that
somebody like that is already self-condemned. The best thing I could do for
him was to rebuke him so as to try to induce a little repentance so that his
attitudes no longer serve to degenerate him to even deeper levels of
deceit. We condemn ourselves through our selfish and ignorant actions and
may continue to suffer the reactions for a very long time.
I am capable of feeling empathy for another and try to understand his
point of view no matter how distorted it may be, and my only desire in
wanting to reprimand him be that he reform himself so as not to continue to
be just another burden on human society. If I am capable of this state of
mind, then the Macrocosmic mind must be capable of so much more. What
we call god is not an avenger or punisher, but only a savior. While it is true
that the laws of karma are inviolable even for god, there are subtle
mechanisms that the Macrocosmic mind has evolved through the
microcosm to bring erring minds back into harmony with existence.
Repentance is not shame or the desire to induce shame or any other
negative tendency into another. Repentance is a very deep and self-
reflective pattern of very rational thoughts and emotions that save one
from the self condemnations of shame. Everything that this little mind of
ours does is interacting with a great universe, a conscious and intelligent
system that pre-exists us and is a lot more aware than one could ever
imagine. The blind and selfish mind only becomes aware of this after much
suffering. Having burned oneself with the fire of suffering and alienation
over and over, one finally begins to awaken and see the law of cause and
effect at work.
To an awakening mind there will always be an opportunity for the
intelligent moral order of the universe to create conditions of grace so as to
call and welcome all microcosms back into unity with the Macrocosmic
Consciousness. The signs are all around but due to selfishness and
separation we cant allow ourselves to really understand them. Grace is for
all but is only understood through a mature mind. This soul naturally
desires a subtler form of existence and once shown the way it is only quite
natural that there is a bit of compunction and repentance for having existed
away from union in suffering and delusion. Repentance can only exist
where there is truly a notion of discernment or viveka (the 6th propensity)
to contrast and reflect the errors of the separate ego. When one truly knows
that the inability to understand ones fears, attachments, resentments and
ambitions have locked one into an absurd existence with no real purpose,
the idea of continuing or falling back into the vain traps of the ego becomes
unbearable. One never wants to return to such a state because it is based
in suffering and delusion. Repentance serves as a microcosmic expression
of the laws of action and reaction and how they are embedded in our
mental structures and is a check and balance system for maintaining
harmonious conduct with the universe. To have experienced the great
wonder of existence, to have encountered a little bit of the infinite presence
in a few clear moments of grace, and to sustain them through meditation
and devotion will always keep ones direction onward.
Although I speak of repentance as the last mental vortex of the spiritual
heart, it can just as well be considered the first if we count from below
upward. Its controlling sound “tha”, is the densest vibration of the Anahata
Vortex. It couples “ta”, a sound dominated by staticity and inertia with “ha”,
the sound of centripetal movement. Repentance, or “tha,” therefore serves
as a propensity that leads all of the dross and density of the human heart
back into the purity of pure spirit. When there are no vrttis to create pride
or repentance that perturb the essence of the spiritual heart, one becomes
empty of form and intention but full of Infinite Consciousness. One’s self is
sacrificed to the heart of the universe.
While it is true that all actions of the microcosm are compensated with
reactions, there are some profound patterns in the mind that truly lead the
microcosm into union. These actions don’t rebound with reactions but
rather dissolve themselves into the Macrocosm. “Be altogether lost in
Brahma, like an arrow in its target.” Because the devoted mind really does
begin to flow and find grace it is received and absorbed into the life of the
universe, reactions of pain and sorrow begin cease because the ego puts up
fewer and fewer projections of separation and makes fewer errors based on
them. The influence of the Vishuddha Vortex enters here. Spiritual practice,
no matter what name or form, must be a practical vehicle to re-align the
microcosmic mental flow with that of the Macrocosmic thought projection
which is this universe. To bring the mind with all of its desires, feelings and
ideas into the light of the I-Witness transforms and expands the limits of the
microcosm. Contemplating the ever-present Atman within one’s very own I-
feeling, the microcosm undergoes spiritual, mental, and biological
evolution; the structures of the mind change and vibrates on higher
frequencies, and the body that it incarnates undergoes subtle
metamorphoses in the nervous and endocrine systems to accompany and
parallel the mental changes. Participating in evolution as a responsible
individual is the greatest duty that a human being has toward the collective
evolution of humanity to something truly dignified and deserving of the
divine potential within.
The Free Self
When the vrttis of the spiritual heart are understood and liberated, their
energy retires inward into pure idea. One feels that from the center of the
chest extends an element of a subtle, invisible air that is not bound by any
form of gravity in this universe. From this realm of light and vibrant pulsing
ideas manifest the entire physical universe. This universe is dominated by
the play of the centripetal and centrifugal forces in a constant combat that
can only be regulated by the Macrocosmic Mind that has spawned them. In
this Aerial Factor we find the nexus between the abstract and material
worlds. Although the aerial factor is a form of energy bound by the
Macrocosmic process of creative involution, the consciousness that
penetrates there isn’t split into particularities of time, space, or person. The
I-feeling is still pure and undivided. Idea is more real than matter. To move
up from here is complete dissolution of the phenomenal self into Spirit, to
move down from here is the materialization of this self into the physical
universe.
A yogi may delight in this ecstasy: to let oneself flow outward only from
the spiritual heart and aerial factor so that your being may touch every
particle of the universe. Everything becomes familiar and pure, even what
is impure wants to change and transform. But even this cannot be
sustained by us forever, it is the drama of the Macrocosm that will go on
forever and ever. There is a part of you that gazes down upon this as well.
To just go inward from here is to deliver to Shiva so many quantum, so
many packets of energy, that have been trapped by Shakti’s great gravity
into material form. All the star-stuff that we have taken in through
digestion, through perception, through ideas and interaction are finally
brought into the Intuitive Mind and liberated from all form through your
recognition that only Brahma exists both within and without. We transmute
creation into godhead each time we truly remember home. Mind is but the
entity that regulates the within and the without, the centripetal and
centrifugal. Macrocosmic mind, or Brahma, sustains and projects the whim
of the entire cosmological order. Microcosmic mind is what contains and
projects this whimsical bundle of ideas and impressions in time and space
with a notion of your person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Parents&lt;a name=&quot;Ref.3.fn1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;file:///home/v/a.m.books/Books/Prout_in_a_Nutshell_01.html#3.fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;)&lt;/sup&gt; often allege that teachers do not teach anything worthwhile nowadays, but I do not feel that this is a very well-considered remark. In actual fact they are only making excuses in order to avoid their responsibilities. At the same time, however, I should add that most teachers demonstrate, through their mental outlook or their actions, far less awareness of their social responsibilities than concern for their own interests. They do not devote even a fraction of the time and energy to building society that they spend making money by any means possible, such as by writing “made easies” [course summaries] or study guides.

Sometimes uneducated or semi-educated parents abuse their children, using bad language and beating them, but the behaviour of teachers is often far more despicable. In many cases, even after studying numerous books on psychology, they deliberately wound the sentiments of their students with their offensive remarks. Instead of trying to rectify the bad habits of their students, they assail their minds with caustic language. There are many teachers who hurt the feelings of students by ridiculing either their castes or their fathers’ occupations, saying, “The plough suits you better than the pen, my boy,” or “You had better join your father at the potter’s wheel.” Even today such utterances come out of the mouths of many teachers. If a student is ugly, there are teachers who will make faces and say, “Your intelligence is like your appearance” – not to mention the beatings and other kinds of physical torture. Even today we can observe that many teachers use fear tactics to compel the students to prepare their lessons. The day such teachers are so unfortunate as to fall sick and miss school, their students go into raptures of joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;How many teachers try to awaken a genuine thirst for knowledge in their students? Some teachers say, “The education system is itself only a profit-making business. What are we supposed to do?” Can they escape their responsibilities with such remarks? Is profit-making education no education at all? Is there no scope for acquiring knowledge in such education? Is it devoid of the seeds of welfare? And surely teachers cannot dismiss everything by saying, “How can we give attention to one child out of a crowd of two or three hundred?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;It must be the teachers’ responsibility to impart knowledge, teach restraint in social life, and give instruction about all the various aspects of collective endeavour, but the parents will have to take on most of the responsibility for the moral and spiritual education of the child. It should be the duty of society as a whole to ensure that the children of immoral and unrighteousness parents are brought up as virtuous citizens. If possible such children should be removed from the unwholesome environment of their parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Minor_Heading&quot;&gt;The Role of Teachers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..6&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Before making further comments about the responsibilities of parents, it is necessary to say something more about teachers. The first point is that teachers must be selected carefully. High academic qualifications do not necessarily confer on a person the right to become a teacher. Teachers must possess such qualities as personal integrity, strength of character, righteousness, a feeling for social service, unselfishness, an inspiring personality and leadership ability. They are samája gurus,&lt;a name=&quot;Ref.3.fn2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;file:///home/v/a.m.books/Books/Prout_in_a_Nutshell_01.html#3.fn2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;)&lt;/sup&gt; and for this reason it is not possible to accept just anyone as a teacher. Because teachers have an extremely important role to play, their professional standards must be very high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..7&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Many people today recall the forest hermitages of ancient India, admonish starved or half-starved teachers for deviating from the lofty ideals of the past, and say that they should again live up to those ideals. Such glib talkers ignore the fact that their high-sounding platitudes do not remove the pangs of hunger. A person who is constantly hungry thinks about food all the time. So if a teacher, under compulsion of poverty, works as a private tutor in four or five places and due to extreme fatigue fails to teach his or her school students properly, should he or she be censured? No, the teacher is not to be blamed at all. In many countries the cost of the monthly meat ration for the dog of a rich person exceeds the salary of a teacher. Under such circumstances how much social consciousness can we expect from the teachers? The salaries of teachers in every country should be on a par with, if not higher than, the salaries of public servants in the judiciary and the executive. It should not be forgotten that the sages of the past used to receive temple endowments, gifts of land and regular sacerdotal fees from the kings. They did not have to go from house to house as tutors to support their families, because the government was directly responsible for solving their mundane problems. While it is true that such sages provided food and clothing to their students, the money for this came from the public and was donated out of reverence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..8&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Simply raising the salaries of teachers, however, does not automatically mean that they will have the opportunity to create ideal men and women, because today in most countries of the world (where teachers generally have the opportunity to live fairly well) teachers nevertheless do not have the right to formulate educational policies. Rather educational policies are generally formulated by professional politicians, most of whom have perhaps no experience in education. If teachers are to be held responsible for building ideal men and women, they must also be given the right to formulate educational policies, instead of being mere teaching machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..9&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Governments may submit their [social] and political needs to the teachers, but the teachers should be free to accept or reject the governments’ proposals without interference. Of course, if the teachers do support any state policy, on the basis of national security or for the good of society as a whole, they will have to actively implement that policy, because the state will then have every legitimate right to their services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..10&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;I mention these things mainly because in our modern world, in those societies where democracy predominates, political factionalism has become a routine affair. In these circumstances it is but natural for every ruling party to try to influence the adolescent mind to further its party interests. But teachers should not try to ingratiate themselves with so-called political benefactors. They should always keep higher ideals before them as they work. Those who are not teachers should not be allowed to interfere in educational matters that come within the jurisdiction of a school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..11&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;So far we have discussed who has the right to determine educational policies, but the matter does not end there. In many countries we can observe in regard to school administration also that people are often given important posts as administrators only because of their wealth, while they themselves are, colloquially speaking, complete idiots. Their great wealth is their sole qualification. Such things occur only in countries where the state, for some reason, fails to carry out its educational responsibilities. Such wealthy school administrators often consider the educated teachers to be mere objects of pity. They put pressure on them in order to ensure that their brainless, dull-witted children pass the examinations. They unnecessarily interfere in educational matters. When their children are taken to task, they angrily chastise the teachers. Such a situation is not at all desirable and does not encourage teachers to perform their duties conscientiously. In their poverty teachers, out of fear of starvation, “serve their term” perfunctorily day after day, or, as a result of continuous attacks on their virtue, one fine morning resign in extreme bitterness and set out in quest of some other profession. If teachers have to work under such conditions, how can they possibly have the strength of mind to keep a watchful eye on their students?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..12&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Minor_Heading&quot;&gt;The Problems of Students&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..13&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;These are the problems of teachers. The students also have some special problems which many people choose not to consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..14&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;I have already pointed out that it is improper to extort anything from students through undue pressure and intimidation. Intimidation appears to work to some extent, but it does not yield lasting results. Whatever students learn from their parents and teachers out of fear fades into oblivion as soon as the agencies of fear disappear. The reason is that their learning and their fear were inseparably associated, so with the disappearance of fear, the knowledge that they had acquired in the course of their education also disappears from the more developed parts of their minds. As soon as the bullying teacher leaves the classroom the students heave a sigh of relief. Within a few hours, whatever they had committed to memory starts growing hazy. Out of fear of failing their examinations students work hard, poring over books, and accomplish ten days’ work in one hour. But after completing their examinations and playing a game of football or visiting the cinema, they forget much of what they had learned, due to the absence of fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..15&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;People in many countries throughout the world are painfully experiencing the detrimental effects of education through the medium of fear. Most educated people lose the abilities they acquired through education after they graduate from school or university and enter their field of work. If I were to assess the value of the education these people received, I would say that most of their time, ability and labour had been wasted or had been spent meaninglessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..16&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;So as I was saying, it will not do to impart education through intimidation. A thirst for knowledge must be awakened, and, to quench that thirst, proper education must be given. Only then will education be worthwhile and develop the body, mind and ideals of the student.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..17&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Children are by nature most inclined towards play, so a thirst for knowledge will have to be awakened in children through the medium of play – children should be educated through play methods. Children are also by nature inclined to listen to fantasies and stories. Through stories children can easily be taught the history and geography of various countries, and they may also be taught the initial lessons of how to practise universalism in their lives. Children love play and stories almost equally, so in their case the two should be equally utilized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..18&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;The dream of the future first crystallizes in the mind of the adolescent. So adolescents should be taught, without indulging in narrow-mindedness, through the medium of idealism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..19&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;The minds of young adults are, however, somewhat inclined towards realism, so in their case pure idealism will not suffice. In order to educate such young adults, a harmonious blend of idealism and realism is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..20&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Teachers must bear in mind that their students – whether adolescents, youths, old people or actual children – are, to them, all just children of different ages; and that they themselves are children like their students. If teachers distance themselves from their students or continually try to maintain a forced gravity, they will not be able to establish sweet, cordial relations with their students. The free and frank exchange of ideas is simply not possible unless a feeling of mutual affection is established. The lack of cordial relations causes many children to heartily wish for the death of either their severe teachers or their abusive parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..21&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Minor_Heading&quot;&gt;The Education System&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..22&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;In many newly-independent countries an attempt is made to recast the education system in a national mould. Without going into the merits of such attempts, it may undoubtedly be said that if these changes do not take into consideration the needs of the students, the education imparted may be nationalistic, but it cannot be humanistic. Like provincialism and communalism, nationalism is highly detrimental to the minds of children. Children’s crystalline judgement power is to a large extent sullied by these sentiments. In newly-independent countries such perverted ideas as “Only my country’s products are good; we need learn nothing from others,” may be heard expressed at any time. Assertions such as “Everything is in the Vedas,” or “The social system that the great prophet So-and-so commanded us to follow cannot be even slightly changed because it is based on the words of God,” or “Such-and-such country learned how to make aeroplanes by studying our country’s Rámáyańa and Mahábhárata” are the results of the national, religious or communal rigidities that have been injected into the minds of the students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..23&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;When the propounders of an education system are obsessed by chauvinistic nationalism, they often, in the name of preserving the national character, try to keep the students of that country segregated from the rest of the world. It must always be borne in mind that the bonds that afford opportunities for mutual contact and understanding between people should never be weakened but should always rather be strengthened, for in this lie the seeds of collective welfare. In order to create a feeling of genuine collective welfare, extreme nationalistic zeal may have to suffer a little jolt, but intelligent people will have to absorb that jolt and make a tremendous effort to overcome that prejudicial zeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..24&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;I mentioned the bonds of human unity. Take, for example, the case of pre-Independence Pakistan or India. Although English came from overseas, it alone was responsible for forging a unifying link among the diverse population of India. Not only that, Indians were introduced to and became acquainted with the rest of the world population through the medium of this language. In those days Indian students who had a general knowledge of two languages – their mother tongue and English – would become eligible to enter the temple of knowledge. If today anybody in India tries to remove the English language, their efforts will be nothing but attempts to break that unifying link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..25&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;It is not proper, under any circumstances, to burden the young shoulders of students with a heavy load of languages simply to satisfy the political whims of the leaders. Just imagine the fate of Sindhi-speaking students in Pakistan today [now Pakistan and Bangladesh]. How many languages do they have to learn? (1) Sindhi, their mother tongue; (2) English, the world language; (3) Arabic or Persian, the religious language; and (4) Urdu or Bengali, the national language, or both these languages if they want good jobs. In other words, as many as five languages are being imposed on the students. Are these students supposed to acquire knowledge or to stagger about carrying a heavy burden of languages? If, however, the nationalistic sentiment can be to some extent restrained, all the languages can be excluded from the syllabus except two: English and the mother tongue. If students study in or awaken their thirst for knowledge through these two languages, then in time, propelled by their own urge, they may learn not only the other three languages, but ten or twenty more as well. In schools and colleges also, it is desirable to offer as many optional languages as possible. Such a policy is not likely to be criticized by anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..26&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;In order for people around the world to be able to communicate, a vishva bháśá [universal or world language] is needed, and the teaching and study of that language should be given equal importance in every country. If we consider the following three qualities of a language – that it should be widely spoken, be easily understood and be capable of powerful expression – English alone is qualified to become the world language. No one in the world should consider English to be the language of England alone, but should rather accept it with an open mind as the common language for the communication of ideas. Doing this will in no way harm any mother tongue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..27&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;If a false sense of prestige prevents any country from adopting the world language, it will certainly not add to the glory of the human race. It is not at all desirable for the people of one country to remain incomprehensible to those of another country. Of course in the distant future people may select another language to replace English as the world language, in accordance with the needs of their age; English cannot keep its position as the world language forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..28&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;It is surely a great injustice to burden the shoulders of the young with the responsibility of paying off the whimsical nationalistic, communalistic or any similar prejudices of their elders. Adults should of course determine the type of education to be given to students to help them develop into worthy citizens in the future. Adults should not, however, be given a completely free hand in the formulation of educational policies merely to allow them to give expression to their predispositions and caprices. The needs and well-being of the younger generation must be safeguarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..29&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Students go to school and sit for examinations in order to pass. Examiners should bear this fact in mind. They should not adopt the rigid position that “Only such-and-such percentage of students will be allowed to pass.” Examiners should take into account only the range of knowledge and the extent of the thirst for knowledge the students possess. They should not trouble themselves over students who omit to dot their “i’s” or cross their “t’s”. Nor do they need to addle their brains about how much lime has fallen from their betel leaf!&lt;a name=&quot;Ref.3.fn3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;file:///home/v/a.m.books/Books/Prout_in_a_Nutshell_01.html#3.fn3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..30&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Minor_Heading&quot;&gt;The Ideals of Teachers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..31&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Having discussed teachers and the education system, something can now be said about ideals. The failings of the education system or the grievances of teachers should not be cited as excuses to avoid this subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..32&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Take, for instance, the psychological atmosphere within which knowledge is imparted to students. It is not [unusual] to see teachers who try to somehow extract the correct answer from their students without having either awakened in them the desire for knowledge or taught them how to acquire the necessary knowledge. There are also many teachers who would like to lecture only and be free of any further responsibilities. These are unpleasant truths, needless to say. Whether such conditions existed in the past or not is for historians to judge, and I certainly hope that they will not exist in the future, but it must be admitted that such a state of affairs does exist at present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..33&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;(The unprofessional behaviour of a handful of teachers may be the reason why the whole teaching profession has become an object of ridicule. If so, I would say that those genuine educators – those who have even a little capacity to work or to make others work according to their own will – should deal very seriously with unprofessional behaviour. This is possible only for those who are directly engaged in the teaching profession, and not for school inspectors.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..34&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Society will gain no lasting benefit if teachers force students to swallow knowledge like quinine pills instead of awakening the thirst for knowledge in the minds of young children, or for that matter in the mind of any student.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..35&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Speaking of ideals, yet another point comes to my mind, and that is the moral character and conduct of teachers. Many teachers demonstrate a flagrant lack of restraint over their language. There are also teachers who, after discussing the abuses and evils of intoxicants in the classroom, immediately go outside and start smoking. This sets an extremely bad example. If the teachers would just use intoxicants, without saying anything about them, it might not be so bad. But this approach naturally encourages the students to be undisciplined. They will think that the use of such things must be enjoyable, and that their teachers deprive them so that they can enjoy them alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..36&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;In many educational institutions there are two or more factions among the teachers, and each faction tries to draw the students into its own camp. Such teachers try to generate a feeling of disrespect in the minds of the students of their group towards the teachers of the other camps by speaking against them. As a result, ultimately a feeling of indiscipline is aroused in the minds of students. It is futile to complain about this and say, “Nowadays students don’t respect law and order.” Is it the fault of the students if those who are supposed to teach them discipline do not discharge that duty properly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..37&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Many teachers and professors actively take part in politics; they often abuse their personal influence and use simple, idealistic young students as tools to achieve their political ends. How on earth can students learn discipline under such circumstances? Politics, at least politics today, is just an instrument for mutual mudslinging. In the political world such things as honesty, simplicity and a sense of discipline simply do not exist. “Crush your adversaries by fair means or foul” is the creed of politics today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..38&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;The principal cause of indiscipline among students is an extreme obsession with politics. Other causes are clearly secondary, and result from the failings of a mercenary social system. The influence of the education system and the behaviour of parents, however, cannot be entirely discounted when it comes to awakening a sense of discipline or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..39&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;I do not think that the interest some students develop in politics can be dampened by those who, for whatever reason, previously encouraged their involvement, no matter how strongly they may later advise them. At present the situation has come to such a pass that mere exhortations will have no effect. To solve this problem the entire education system will have to be reorganized. It is necessary to have a thorough grasp of the psychology of students in order to be able to infuse a sense of discipline into their minds and impart proper education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..40&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Minor_Heading&quot;&gt;The Responsibilities of Parents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..41&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;The mental outlook of children has already been moulded in a particular fashion by the influence of their family environment before they start school. No matter what or how much they learn at school, it is extremely difficult for them to free themselves from the influence of their family. Drawing on what they have learned in the family, the immature minds of children begin to learn about the world and understand it, and to receive ideas and master language so that they can express those ideas. Unhesitatingly they adopt their elders’ way of looking at the world. Hence the primary responsibility for acquainting children with the world lies with their parents or guardians. Children will become assets of society in the future to the extent that their parents or guardians discharge their duties properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..42&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;I have no hesitation in saying that today’s adults have not yet developed a scientific method of training children’s minds. Even most so-called educated and refined people, let alone average adults, are either ignorant about or indifferent to the education of their children. Their ignorance may be pardoned, but how can we forgive their indifference? The family into which a child has been born will naturally have to bear the primary responsibility for the physical, mental and spiritual development of that child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..43&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;It can be said that ordinary people, like teachers, face many types of problem in their lives; in fact teachers’ problems are only a reflection of larger social problems. It is quite true that in the modern material world strenuous efforts to conquer the limitations of time, place and person are apparent everywhere. It is as if human beings are being forcibly dragged forward by the hair of their heads. Speed is the main consideration; whether any good is accomplished or not is a secondary factor. Thus different social trends are unable to maintain a harmonious pace in their forward movement. Some trends are far advanced in their development while others lag behind. This causes some parts of the social structure which were close together to move apart, and other parts which were once apart to come together, leading to the collapse of the entire structure. The thatched hut is still the same, but electrical wiring has been strung through it. The only food available is salt and boiled rice, but the ordinary old clay stove has been replaced by an electric “heater” [hotplate]. Such incongruities are now common in society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..44&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;The views established in our psychic world regarding the different trends of life have so unnaturally diverged from one another that the naturalness of the human mind has been spoiled. Human beings have lost the capacity to think anything, but somehow pass their days with a lot of hollow, mechanical mental objects. The caravan of our social life thus rolls on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..45&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;So today parents may rightly say, “We have almost no vital energy left after exchanging blows and counter-blows with life. We have no chance to mould the minds of our children with the care and tenderness of our hearts. All the sweetness and finer sensibilities of our minds have been sucked dry by the harsh realities of life. How can we take care of our children? We cannot even provide them with proper food and clothing. How can we know what they are thinking? Do we have the time to understand anything properly at all? We know children should be taught through the medium of play and entertainment, both at home and outside, but is it possible for us to do that? We even have to disturb our talented son at his studies to send him to the grocer’s to buy salt, cooking oil, spices, etc. We know it is wrong, but there is no alternative, for keeping a servant is beyond our means.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..46&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;There may be some truth in this, but it is not the point at issue here. In order to develop a healthy outlook, the most important thing children need is robust idealism. To impart this, parents require only two virtues: self-restraint and good judgement. Let us discuss good judgement first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..47&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;The method of extracting work by terrorizing the minds of children is not only made use of by a particular type of teacher, it is also often still more harmfully practised by parents. They frighten their children, tell them lies, engage in scurrilous brawls before them, and deceive and torment them; but they still expect that some day their children will become respectable members of society – that their children will bring glory to their family name. When their children are reluctant to drink milk or sleep, they terrify them by invoking imaginary goblins or frightful ghosts. Children initially have no fear, yet a fearful panorama is played out before them. Through this practice the parents may achieve some temporary gain, but even if the children wait a lifetime, they can never be compensated for the harm done to them. Even when these same children attain young adulthood, the thought of ghosts will not leave their minds – ghosts will become their permanent companions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..48&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;When the parents are about to go on a trip or go to a show, or when they are invited to a pleasant function or a social outing, the children may start whining or nattering to accompany them. At such times many parents tell lies without a qualm; somehow they dupe their children and leave. When the children realize what has happened, they also learn to tell lies; and to hide their intentions or their actions from their parents, they gradually start lying more and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..49&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Parents deceive their children in many ways. By calling sweet things bitter and pleasant things unpleasant, they prevent their children from enjoying them. But by disregarding parental injunctions and prying inquisitively, as is the wont of human nature, children discover the truth. Then they realize that their parents have been deceiving them. As a result they start deceiving not only their parents, but their friends and classmates as well. So it is abundantly clear that children are taught the first lessons in the arts of lying and deception by their own parents at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..50&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;In a family it is natural that differences of opinion will arise among the adults; when they do, the adults should reconcile their differences considering each other’s opinions. Unfortunately they often lack the requisite mental make-up to reach an amicable agreement – each tries to convince everybody else of his or her viewpoint without caring about the opinions of others. The result is an outburst of unreasonable obstinacy – the adults lose all self-control and behave in a gross and vulgar manner. The effect on the minds of the children is disastrous. Children thus learn obstinacy from their elders. If the mother or those with whom the children spend most of their time is obstinate, the neglected children will, in most cases, become noticeably obstinate, and they will have to carry this psychic ailment around with them for a long time. If, on the other hand, as is sometimes the case, the wishes and desires (if they are not unreasonable) of children are fulfilled, the children will not have the opportunity to learn obstinacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..51&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;In some families the parents have lost their peace of mind due to poverty or some other cause and oppress their children with or without reason. Naturally the children lose respect for their parents, which further aggravates family indiscipline. The parents have to put up with more unrest, adding to their lack of peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..52&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Parents who are middle- or high-level officials in the public works or police departments have to get work done through others or supervise manual labourers or subordinates, so they often forget to talk sweetly. Some become accustomed to using abusive language, and some to issuing commands. Due to this their children do not have an opportunity to learn to speak with restraint. Such children suffer from a superiority complex, even within their circle of friends. In their future lives it will be extremely difficult for them to love people and create a congenial social environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..53&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Some parents may claim that it is impossible to maintain a balanced life in an age full of problems, where they are extremely busy with numerous activities. I maintain, however, that it is possible for an intelligent parent to avoid the mistakes I have discussed. If parents fail to carry out their basic duties, I am compelled to say that, although they live in society, they are guilty of encouraging an antisocial mentality. By encouraging their children to develop a criminal psychology, they give unnecessary trouble to the police. The main point is this: for want of a little care, children are deprived of the opportunity to become complete human beings, even though they have a human structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..54&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Minor_Heading&quot;&gt;Sáhityikas – the Teachers of Society&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..55&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;There is yet another section of society whom I cannot absolve from the responsibility of educating children. They are the sáhityikas.&lt;a name=&quot;Ref.3.fn4&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;file:///home/v/a.m.books/Books/Prout_in_a_Nutshell_01.html#3.fn4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;)&lt;/sup&gt; Actually sáhityikas are a type of teacher – they are the teachers of society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..56&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Humans have a deep longing for things far away. No one is satisfied by things that are within their grasp. Even if the mind is satisfied, the soul remains dissatisfied. That is why the world of dreams is sweeter than the mundane reality. Sáhityikas catch an image of the mundane world in the mirror of fantasy, which is why their literature easily attracts the human mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..57&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Such dream castles take on most importance in the minds of children. The more children get used to the impact of reality as they grow up, the more the dream subsides. People growing up want to bring the mirror of dreamland down closer to the mundane world, in order to see a reflected picture that is more like their own lives; but this would never occur to the minds of children. Children want to release their golden pegasus so that it will fly towards a coloured rainbow in the sky of their dreams. They want to run away to some unknown destination and play with the moon and the stars. Losing themselves in such fantasies, they surrender to the soothing influence of a lullaby and gradually fall asleep. Those sáhityikas who keep this peculiarity of the child’s psychology in mind as they write can easily win children’s hearts. Their wise words and precepts will then be readily absorbed. That is why I call sáhityikas the teachers of society. If these teachers are conscious of their responsibilities, children may be brought back to the right path despite improper guidance at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..58&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Cheap detective novels, adventure stories and nationalistic or communalistic stories may attract youngsters, but they gradually deprive them of sound judgement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..59&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;The biographies of great personalities can attract youngsters if they are written in simple and attractive language. By great personalities I mean only those who work with the good of all humanity in mind. I am not thinking of a great Indian, a great Englishman or Englishwoman, a great Russian or a great American. In society, however, there are few people who can claim to be worthy human beings. Because of their saḿskáras [mental reactive momenta], their fear or their deliberate pursuit of self-interest, people often want to divide human society. Such people try to impose their defective outlook on the minds of children through the literature about them, so that in the future these children will become their ardent supporters. Literary biographers must keep their pens scrupulously free from the influence of these non-humans (that is, those who should not be called humans but rather something else).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..60&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Nowadays some countries are propagating particular communal or economic theories which support intolerance; thus through perverted literature the minds of children are becoming contaminated. In the future these children may become the members of a community, or of a party which propagates a particular ism, but to what extent will they identify as human beings?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..61&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Minor_Heading&quot;&gt;Radio&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..62&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;There is much scope for telling well-written, educational stories on the radio. Radio broadcasters can very easily delight the ears and minds of children with attractive and educational stories written by sáhityikas who have a knowledge of child psychology. If parents cannot afford radios at home, educational programmes can be broadcast at some scheduled time in schools, parks or even playgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..63&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;However, the problems referred to above may remain unsolved if broadcasting networks are under the control of a particular party, because then the networks will be more interested in creating supporters to further the interests of their party than in building people’s character. Of course there is a way to avoid such an eventuality, and that is to entrust the management of broadcasting networks to boards of non-political, cultured educators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..64&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Minor_Heading&quot;&gt;Commemoration Ceremonies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..65&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Some time ago many educated sections of society around the world complained that the commemoration ceremonies held in their respective countries for their departed leaders and great persons were not being observed in a befitting manner. That is to say, these countries, by neglecting their revered personalities, were gradually losing their ideals. Such complaints may not be wholly unfounded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..66&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Observing the manner in which these ceremonies and anniversaries are celebrated, however, I do not think that they have any value. Unscrupulous Mr. Cutthroat Crook or Mr. Villainous Leech, who has no ideology at all, is invited, in the hope of his making a fat donation, to act as the president or chairman. The speakers, one after another, deliver high-sounding speeches in polished and literary language, often concluding with, “The time has come to reflect anew over the legacy that So-and-so has left us. Just delivering and hearing speeches will not do; his legacy must be translated into action. Then and then alone will this commemoration ceremony be worthwhile.” At the end of the speech, looking proudly left and right, they ask, “Well, how was my lecture?” Evidently the speaker never meant to translate So-and-so’s ideals into action, but spoke to solicit the approbation of the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..67&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;I have not said, nor will I say, that these commemoration ceremonies are totally useless. If it is the genuine wish of the sponsors of anniversaries or commemoration ceremonies to give a practical shape to the ideals of a deceased person, the ideals should be given greater prominence in such functions and should be clearly presented to the public, especially to children, instead of reducing them to platitudes mouthed by dishonest speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..68&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Minor_Heading&quot;&gt;Pictures and Dramas&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..69&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;This can best be done through the use of pictures and dramas. The Rámáyańa is more appealing and educational when presented in pictures than when depicted in books, because those who cannot read can thereby understand the inner language of the artist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..70&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;After pictures come dramas. In a well-written and well-acted drama the audience feels the living reality of each character. A favourite leader, a revered and distinguished personality, is presented speaking to people, particularly to the children, in a congenial manner. Then the audience open the closed doors of their minds and enter into a free mental communion. So in my opinion no matter what the age of the student, a well-written and well-acted drama can do a tremendous amount of good, and can be a great asset to the spread of real education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..71&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Minor_Heading&quot;&gt;Cinema&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..72&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Today the cinema seems to be very popular with people of all ages. As a result film technology will gradually rise to ever-greater heights of technical excellence. The opportunity provided by the cinema to establish good relations with people can be very well utilized for educational purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..73&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Seduced by the bestial instincts hidden in the secret recesses of their minds, people surrender to base propensities. But improvements in education and the social environment can help to bring this beast under control and make it obey their commands. To achieve this the first thing people have to do is to wage war against their animal propensities, which is no easy task. So cunning exploiters, by encouraging animality, are able to bring people under their sway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..74&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;The cinema industry suffers from this malady. This industry is controlled by a handful of business persons who make films according to popular taste and demand. While ordinary people naturally run after those films which in their ideas, language or visual images cater to their base propensities, such ideas, language or images instantly distort the ideals of the idealist beyond recognition. It is quite in character for purely commercial film producers to exploit these human weaknesses to their own advantage, and this is exactly what is happening. Generally youngsters outnumber older people at movies marked “A” (“For Adults Only”). Sometimes the words “For Adults Only” are so alluringly displayed that young people feel even more attracted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..75&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;For the sake of social education, such a situation cannot be permitted to continue for a long time. If we have even the slightest intention of using cinema for the benefit of society, it has to be placed in the hands of non-governmental cultural bodies and not in the hands of business persons or the government. Because in countries where the cinema is under government control, the possibility exists of using the film industry more for party propaganda than for the spread of education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..76&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;A great drawback to the cinema when it is used solely for propaganda is that the beauty of both drama and literature is not given the scope to fully develop – the cinema is reduced to the level of a megaphone, spouting forth party propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..77&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Giving experienced and competent directors the opportunity and the complete freedom to make benevolent cinema does not yield bad results. Rather it can spread joy and education simultaneously. This fact was fully substantiated by a film produced by the West Bengal government some time ago.&lt;a name=&quot;Ref.3.fn5&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;file:///home/v/a.m.books/Books/Prout_in_a_Nutshell_01.html#3.fn5&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3..78&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Finally I would like to say that those teachers, dramatists, actors, writers and radio artists whose help is essential to sow the seeds of true development in the minds of children and to ensure that these seeds grow into small seedlings, flourish, and bring forth foliage, flowers and fruits, must be freed from worldly worries so that all their energies and capabilities can be completely and properly utilized. Nothing will be achieved if we repeatedly talk to them about the magnitude of their responsibilities without trying to solve their problems.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">
    &lt;p&gt;The inner spirit of the word samája [“society”] is “to move together”. That is, the vitality of society depends on two factors: its existence – a collective creation – and its inherent dynamism. The characteristic of an activating force is that it does not move in a perfectly straight line, rather its movement is rhythmic or undulating; and this rhythm or wave is not monomorphic but systaltic. The force that moves society forward is also systaltic. When the nature of movement of individual life does not hinder the rhythm of collective movement of society, there remains the possibility of forming a society from the collective movement of numerous individuals – there lies the possibility of creating a universal intellectual structure inspired by the brilliance of sublime ideas.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;If we try to judge the nature of something by analysing the inner spirit of the word used to describe it, we will have to say without hesitation that humanity has not yet learned how to build a “society” worthy of the name. Even to this day, people have only a very vague notion of the reasons for needing society, let alone of how to build a true society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Movement means the active effort to destroy an existing structure and construct another. The very effort to destroy old, worn-out systems gives rise to the possibility of creating newer systems and codes. It is wrong to infer that because a force is temporarily static after being attacked it is inert; it still possesses the potential to strike back. Of course the force under attack tends to absorb the striking force in an effort to survive, but it cannot do this successfully. I have already explained why. To retard the systalticity of the movement of the striking force is contrary to the characteristics of force. That is why vested interests cannot hold back the progress of society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;A careful study of the social history of the world will reveal that until now every attempt at prativiplava [counter-revolution] has not only caused enormous psychic and financial suffering and plunged humanity into the mire of gloom and despair, but has also lengthened the period of social contraction. This in turn, in the next phase, has helped to accelerate the speed of the period of social expansion – has inspired the chariot of revolution to advance towards victory with greater momentum.&lt;a name=&quot;Ref.2.fn1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;file:///home/v/a.m.books/Books/Prout_in_a_Nutshell_01.html#2.fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Does this forceful, dynamic movement manifest as a senseless whim, devoid of wisdom? No. In individual life the propensities of an underdeveloped mind appear whimsical to the external world, but in collective life, that is, in social life, there is no scope for whimsical movement. Nor would I say that dynamic movement is always inspired by wisdom. But I will say this: without wisdom, it is impossible to express dynamic movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;The internal clash of forces provides the dynamic movement with constructive guidance. However, the amount of wisdom that is required to stop the erosion of the internal vitality of the dynamic movement is not manifest in all individuals. There are some people who manifest a great deal of wisdom, but, reasonably speaking, no matter how much that manifestation of wisdom is criticized as being a relative thing, it has some special value of its own. The easiest way to determine this special value is to ascertain its efficacy in the field of application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Now the word “efficacy” often raises a storm in the philosophers’ teacups, because both materialists and idealists argue in more or less the same way. Here I do not want to say much about the idealists, but I must say that the arguments of the materialists are to some extent contradictory, because the efficacy of something in the field of application can only be judged by a sound mind, and at the time of passing judgement the mind has to be kept above matter. Let me elaborate this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Matter is the be-all and end-all of materialism. To a materialist, mind has been created out of matter by a process of chemical transformation, and so it does not have any independent or special significance beyond its materialistic value. Who, then, is to pass judgement on the efficacy of something? Can we justifiably accept the mind as a judge when its very existence is in principle denied? And conversely, if the mind is elevated to the status of a judge, does materialism retain its validity? No, it capitulates to idealism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;There are many other contradictory arguments in the philosophy of materialism, but they are not relevant to the present discussion. However, I do not want to dismiss the world as illusory either, as do the flighty idealists. In my opinion, mind must be given the special importance it deserves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Although the physical body appears to imbibe ideas, psychologists will surely agree that the mind is the receiver or perceiver of ideas. They will also have to accept that the appraisal of any object in the absolute sense is not possible unless we can find a yardstick – for all times, all places and all people – to evaluate the mind. In the vast multitude of relativities, how is it possible to determine an acceptable absolute measurement for all times, all places and all people? From a little analytical study of the functional differences between the subjective and objective parts of the mind, whether underdeveloped or developed, it is clear that the mind cannot maintain its unit identity without an object. Mind must have an object to contemplate. If that object transcends time, place and person, it will then be possible for the mind to perceive the temporal, spatial and personal factors from a broad angle of vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Only a magnanimous and pervasive mind deserves to be called the Macrocosm. The ideological component of the unit mind which provides the initial inspiration for the individual to attain that Cosmic state, is called “morality”. Every aspect of morality sings the song of the Infinite, even in the midst of the finite. In other words, or put more simply, I wish to say that those magnanimous propensities which help to establish one in the Cosmic state are the virtuous principles of morality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Social life must take morality as its starting point – it must take inspiration from morality. Only then will society be able to put an end to the erosion caused by divisive internal conflicts and to advance towards victory. But before we can start work, we also have to understand the difference between morality and religion, or so-called dharma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Dharma means the attainment of bliss or the endeavour to attain bliss through regular sádhaná [spiritual practices] in the subtler spheres of one’s nature. This blissful state is considered by wise people to be Brahma [the Supreme Entity], and by devotees to be one’s very soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;The word dharma is often loosely used for so-called religion. The reason for this is that the founders of almost all the world’s religions propagated their respective doctrines among the common people, claiming them to be the messages of God [i.e., to be dharma]. These founders never followed the path of logic. Whatever their intention might have been, the result was that humanity lost its supreme treasure, its rationality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;In the Middle Ages some selfish people proclaimed to the backward masses, “I am the messenger of God. Whatever I say is a revelation from God,” just to inject fear and terror into people’s minds. Was it beneficial for humanity to have such doctrines imposed on them in this way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Almost every religion has claimed that only its followers are God’s chosen people and that the rest of humanity is cursed and bound by the chains of Satan. One religion has declared, “Our prophet is the only saviour. There is no escape from mundane sufferings except by taking refuge in him.” Another religion has declared, “I am the last prophet. Prayers must be said before God a specific number of times in a certain manner each day. Special animals must be sacrificed on particular days. These are the wishes of merciful God. Those who follow these injunctions will attain heaven on the Day of Judgement.” Yet another religion says, “Know ye, my son, thy God is the only God. All other gods are false gods.” Just imagine, all these religions preach universal fraternity, and yet this universal fraternity is kept within the confines of their own community.&lt;a name=&quot;Ref.2.fn2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;file:///home/v/a.m.books/Books/Prout_in_a_Nutshell_01.html#2.fn2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;)&lt;/sup&gt; Humanity gasps for breath at such preposterous claims of universal fraternity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Carried away by the grandiose slogans of their respective religions, the followers of these religions have at different times whipped up a frenzy of communal&lt;a name=&quot;Ref.2.fn3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;file:///home/v/a.m.books/Books/Prout_in_a_Nutshell_01.html#2.fn3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;)&lt;/sup&gt; hatred and indulged in orgies of genocide. Had their founders seen such sights, they would have hidden their faces in utter shame. Of all the bloodshed that took place in the Middle Ages, a major part was a natural consequence of this communal “universal fraternity”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Directly or indirectly, religion encourages communalism. “Communalism” means a group [groupist] psychology based on religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;In the distant past, long before the Middle Ages, so-called religions repeatedly tried to “show the light” to the simple, ignorant masses, and are still doing so today; and in the process they have in most cases created disasters. In fact, they do not feel any genuine love for humanity. The standard-bearers of these religions have never hesitated to use force of arms, wily intellect or financial power to gain some petty mundane advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;That is why I maintain that throughout history religions have proved to be flagrantly unworthy institutions, incapable of providing even the physical necessities of life, let alone spiritual salvation. By preaching disharmony, they have systematically prevented people from understanding that they are part of one integrated human society. And in support of their interdictions, they have cited many irrational precedents – a load of mouldy, rotten, worm-eaten papyrus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Religion tries to transform the human mind into a state of staticity, because anything static is easily exploited. However, inertia is the exact opposite of the nature of the mind. A knotty problem! The founders of religion wanted human beings to give up their dynamic nature, and out of fear or delusion, unquestioningly accept certain ideas as the infallible truth. To prevent their shallow knowledge from being exposed, some so-called religious teachers avoided answering people’s questions by pretending to observe silence. This got around all the fuss of answering queries, and even gave the person the opportunity to appear sagacious. In order to stifle the inquisitiveness of the human mind, some of these charlatans even used to claim that an inquisitive nature is extremely bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Read any so-called religious book: one will seldom find anything resembling tolerance of the religious beliefs of others. I am not saying that one should accept whatever people say, but surely non-acceptance and intolerance are not the same. Why is there a mania for refuting the views of others anyway? If necessary, different views can be compared and presented in philosophical books. The philosophical and psychological loopholes in an argument may be pointed out without being disrespectful. But is the attempt to insult others indicative of magnanimity? In so-called religious books there is a greater tendency to refute the religious doctrines of others than to propagate one’s own ideas. Observing all these machinations, genuine theologists cannot hold religion in high esteem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Wise people say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Sloka&quot;&gt;Yuktiyuktamupádeyaḿ vacanaḿ bálakádapi;
Anyaḿ trńamiva tyájyamapyuktaḿ Padmajanmanáh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;*   *   *&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Sloka&quot;&gt;Kevalaḿ shástramáshrityaḿ na karttavyo vinirńayah;
Yuktihiina vicáre tu dharmahánih prajáyate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;“If a child says something rational, it should be accepted, and if the Supreme Creator says something irrational, it should be totally rejected.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;*   *   *&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;“It is undesirable to accept something just because it is written in the scriptures, because if irrational sayings are accepted and implemented, the decline of dharma will be the result.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;The derivative meaning of the word niiti [“morality”] is “that which contains the principle of leading”. It is the starting point on the path of spiritual practices. But this is not the only significance of morality. If morality fails to provide human beings with adequate guidance about how to move towards perfection, it does not deserve to be called morality. As morality is distinguished by its capacity to lead and inspire human beings, it cannot afford to lose its dynamic nature by limiting itself to a specific time, place and person. Morality is a living force, the practice of which makes the mind increasingly contemplative, thereby establishing it in supreme subtlety, in supreme cognition. There is a state from which human beings cannot be led to some other state – the question does not arise. Morality is only worthy of the name if it can inspire human beings to reach that state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Moralism is not the unrealistic dream of the idealist, nor is it the means of fulfilling the mundane needs of the materialist. Rather it is something that provides people with the possibility of merging their mundane objectivity into supramundane Cognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;The spirit of morality will have to be instilled in human beings from the moment that they first start to learn the lessons of interaction. By interaction I mean social interaction. Viewed from this perspective, the mind of a child is the best receptacle for morality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;But who will impart moral training or education? Parents find fault with teachers, and teachers in turn argue that they cannot give personal attention to an individual child in a crowd of two or three hundred children. Although it is true that most parents are either uneducated or semi-educated, and while it is not unreasonable to expect that teachers will be well-educated, it is not proper to place the sole responsibility for children’s moral education on the shoulders of their teachers. Increasing the number of teachers in educational institutions may partially solve the problem of moral education, but the key to the solution lies with the parents themselves. In cases where the parents are unfit to shoulder this responsibility, the teachers and well-wishers of society will have to come forward and demonstrate their greater sense of responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para_Indent&quot;&gt;Remember, humanity’s very existence is based on morality; when morality leads human beings to the fullest expression of their finer human qualities, then alone is its practical value fully realized. The concerted effort to bridge the gap between the first expression of morality and establishment in universal humanism is called “social progress”. And the collective body of those who are engaged in the concerted effort to conquer this gap, I call “society”.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Anybody who has looked into the abyss of his or her consciousness knows that the
abyss looks back at you, as Nietzche said. The unconscious mind is a very live and
active zoo of escaped animals raging about in pure chaos and savagery. Does
their years of pent-up frustration make them even more crazy when they finally
escape? And in all of this unintelligible impulse speaks back from the chasm some
kind of insidious intelligence. In modern psychology, this hidden intentionality has
been called the id, the shadow, or the unconscious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pluma Blanca called this
entity “psorax”. His definition of this entity of the unconscious is much more
mystical and profound than any other explanation that I know. It is more of a
practical understanding of how the mind creates frustrated realities that remain
trapped within one, like an itch under the skin. He called it psorax because he saw
it as the vital, pranic energy that becomes contaminated and gets trapped behind
the skin, in the physical body. This blocked vitality distorts the body’s natural
functions and may accumulate like a festering sore attracting more mental
parasites like itself to itself, thus making a hodge-podge stew of evil and illness.
This idea makes more sense when one understands deeply the relation between
the mind and the body and how prana, or vital energy moves between them.
Psorax is a trapped energy, a mental plasm that can’t effectively project itself
outwardly as it would like to. Each time it does it becomes even more frustrated. It
has the intelligence of mind behind it, but the frustrated intentionality toward
matter, or the physical body pulling upon it. This is the reason that by living with
false ideas about oneself or the world is the greatest danger of conscious, human
existence. Materialism is the greatest of deprivations as it destroys the mind
slowly but surely. Not having this clarity and responsibility of how each one of us
is a co-creator in this creation always leads to a fall. Psorax is a psycho-physical
entity that in some ways is self-created by the individual while at the same time is
aided by the fact that there are exchanges between these entities of psorax
between human beings, or minds incarnated in physical human bodies. One can
receive as well as transmit this psychic virus in much the same way that one
receives and transmits physical viruses.
A practical example: you are at peace. There are only a few light, positive
thoughts in the mind and some pleasant feelings. Behind this subtle activity of
mind is a deep, mysterious witness that just pleasantly is. Out of nowhere, it
seems, there enters a dark, violent image on the mental scene. Is it my own
unconscious attacking my peace, or is it because another person has come near
and I sense his suffering? If I’m not at peace, then I may never understand and
just get locked into a reception and transmission of negativity. This seed wants to
take root within me, it vibrates my body and perhaps excites some memories and
fears. It wants to become one with me. Only from a state of deep calm and non-
judgement one can begin to witness these activities; how they affect the mind,
change the feelings, and even how and where these influences vibrate and take
root in the physical body. Most importantly is to distinguish your’s from another’s
psorax. Pluma Blanca was an advanced yogi as well as a healer, and used his
pinnacled knowledge to observe these phenomenon, how they create physical
and mental illness, and developed ways of curing these ailments based on this
understanding.
Deep, sincere meditation is of course the most effective manner of seeing and
processing the shadow, but this depends on so much: mental health, physical
health, determination and discernment that are only developed by ardent efforts
in one’s spiritual life. In yoga, yama and niyama is the base of this practice. This
practical morality imparts self awareness and practical universal ideas of how to
maintain mental balance through proper personal and social responsibility.
Without these fundamental ideas of humanism imparted to individuals one is but
a mix of animal impulses and social determination, or a game of Russian roulette.
A society without spiritual principles that foster ethical awareness is but a vehicle
for destructive, unconscious forces where psorax takes all into the abyss. I think
this is why Pluma Blanca lived in a cave and only taught a few good people.
Anandamurti, on the other hand, impulsed others to fight within society against
the depraving effects of what he termed “negative microvita”. Both are right
according to who they were, where they were, and what they expressed as
enlightened individuals. Its not enough to believe and conceptualize about such
things. Beliefs and opinions give rise to superstition and dogmas about ghosts,
hauntings, and possessions, and the like. Without the efforts of both of these men
who spoke about these phenomenon in the most practical and scientific manner
possible to speak of such phenomenon, I know that I would be even more in the
dark about understanding negative microvita or psorax, and perhaps be yapping
about the devil and hell-fire and salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Early in the kundalini awakening when I was still a student in the university, I had many experiences that shook my world apart.  There was a period where I had many strange visions that didn’t make sense to me until years later.  During meditation I would feel that I was merging into the whole city of Austin around me.   My mind would expand outward beyond the city and I would get lost in bliss.  It was terrifying yet exhilarating.  It was the death of the little “I,” In one of these experiences I had a waking dream in which I knew I was seeing myself 5 years in the future.  I was in Austin but on a farm outside the city where I was very happy and at peace.  I thought to myself that it was absurd because I had no plans of remaining in Austin after graduation.  I forgot all about this dream until I found myself at this very same farm 5 years later.  The details of the vision like a telephone line crossing the property by a creek proved exact.  Meanwhile, back in ‘94, the vision continued.  In the next part of the vision I knew it was 10 years into the future now and the scene changed.  I was in Mexico in the middle of a war.  I felt very tense in this part of the vision but the scene changed into a third scene where I was far above Austin, almost in outer space.  I looked down and the world was very different.  The coast line was much more inward.  There were fewer people but there was much more respect between them.  I saw that they understood the lesson that nature gave them.    I didn’t know when in the future this third part of the vision occurred, just that it was sometime after the Mexico part.  I wasn’t even sure if I was alive on the planet, or floating without a body in some ethereal space from where I was observing in the dream.  It didn’t matter because there was finally peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t necessarily believe in prophecies, but when a vision has proven right 2 out of 3 times, then my ears start to perk up a little about the third part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There are still living some very great yogis that so beautifully reflect the influence of the grace that Anandamurti showered on his closest disciples. A great master like Anandamurti could heal any disease, physical or mental because he could see the subtle causes deep in the mind and also because he had infinite love. Being close to his closest disciples was the greatest blessing of my life and I owe everything to those sincere beings that have sacrificed their lives for the work of dharma. I met some who reflected their guru’s compassion so deeply that they began to take on the negative samskaras or karmic reactions of others so that those struggling could develop in their practices and become strong themselves. It is not that they will this, rather, it is that because of their own spiritual freedom and compassionate realization, the Macrocosmic Mind may express this grace through them. People of this category are the most valuable people in human society. Their sole duty on this planet is to help others and maintain the balance of dharma. Some of them are very ill as they are aging and their physical bodies no longer have the energy to burn off the samskaras of others. Despite the fact that so many of their fellow disciples are falling from the path and have only plagued and bogged them down with their deviant expressions, these noble few are still keeping the mission of dharma alive and vibrant. Without these beacons of hope, the work of Anandamurti would indeed be lost. Everything I have said and done against those whom I believe are only harming their work was of my own planning and doing. My only intention has been to reveal the hypocrites, criminals, and spiritual power-mongers that are causing so much harm to their spiritual society and the legacy of Anandamurti.&lt;/p&gt;
