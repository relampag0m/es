Prana, the subtle energy that functions between the mental chitta and the physical nerve cells, gets suspended during nirvikalpa samadhi. The breath stops, the heart almost stops and the mind ceases to function without the pulsation of prana that always flows with the breath. During this phase before blissful oblivion one can tactually feel a warm glow around the pineal area in the brain vibrating Om at the tone of C-sharp. The blissful feeling also descends into the anahata like a cool balm. All is sweet, one sees the immortal Self as it always has been. Memories of your past become memories that the Self had while diving down into your every unforgettable memory. The infinite being has always lived your life and sees your every memory from the eternal now of the I-Witness. It fully loves and accepts and absorbs you because you are It now. Then one forgets everything and realizes that one has not breathed nor been conscious of the body nor the outside world for perhaps several hours. I have known cases of yogis who suspended their breath in samadhi for 10 hours. This is experiential proof of nirvikalpa samadhi and of immortality the Self who is verily the great Brahma. In this experience first there is Om, the bliss, the the opening of Hunab Ku, and then the silence and breathlessness in union with the mystery of mysteries. In perfect equilibrium, the entire entity of mind and thus the entire phenomenological identity is suspended in the Shiva-Shakti godhead.
