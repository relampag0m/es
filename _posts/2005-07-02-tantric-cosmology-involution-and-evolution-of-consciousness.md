Metaphysics and psychology are unified in Tantra. Ultimately, the
deepest studies of our inner nature merge with absolute reality beyond our
relative mental, psychological projections about reality. The still, quiet, and
introspective mind can be focused and tuned in to the greater universe.
One learns to live in harmony with an inner peace and wisdom that
connects the personal, microcosmic being with an inward, hidden order in
the Macrocosm, the universe. The Tantric theories about creation, involution, and evolution
are very deep and complex. I refer the serious metaphysical reader to Idea
and Ideology of Anandamurti or the works of Sir John Woodruff for a more
complete description of Tantric cosmology and metaphysics. This book is
more focused on psychology and phenomenology than metaphysics.
Central to Tantric cosmology are the concepts of Shiva and Shakti.
Shiva is infinite consciousness and Shakti is divine, creative energy. Shiva
is the transcendent First Father of our Consciousness and Shakti is the
Great Mother Creator. They are inseparable in essence, like fire and its
capacity to burn. Together they are Brahma, the Supreme Consciousness,
or godhead, to use a concept from Western mysticism.

Shiva andShakti have separate names so that we can conceive of the distinction
between essential being and the activity that results from this being. Shiva
is infinite being, an infinite ocean of consciousness. Shakti, the creative
energy, is the force that creates waves on the ocean. Shiva is absolute
being, consciousness, and bliss, while Shakti is the energy behind change,
creation, and becoming. Unified in Shiva, Shakti is tranquil and there is no
expression, like a placid ocean. This is the godhead, or Brahma, where
there is no change or becoming, no universe, planets, life, nor Big-Bang. All
is one, eternal and infinite. When Shakti awakens her creative activity, she
begins to create waves on this infinite ocean of Shiva. She only appears to
be separate because of the multiplicity of the apparently separate waves
she creates. Finer waves are finer aspects of creation, while grosser waves
are condensed, material levels of creation. All is Brahma, all comes from
the Shiva-Shakti godhead, whether manifest nor non-manifested in creative
expression. There exists no other entity than Brahma.
When Shakti becomes active creation comes into being. Her creative
activity burgeons out of the essence of Shiva. Shiva is the “material” or
basic stuff of creation and Shakti is the operating, creative force that forms
Shiva into created manifestation. Everything that exists is a wave on the
ocean of Shiva vibrated and sustained by the infinite energetic potential of
Shakti. The whole universe is a spectrum of vibrations from the finest
wavelengths of the Macrocosmic Mind to the grossest levels of matter. Carl
Sagan referred to our material world as “star stuff” and provoked a newunderstanding of how we see the material world. Tantric cosmology would
go even further and state that “star stuff” is but Consciousness bound by
Shakti into matter. It is the infinite being of Shiva that is in the essence of
all. The created universe is considered maya or cosmic illusion because we
perceive it as separate from the great Consciousness within.
Creation burgeons from the infinitely subtle and moves toward cruder
manifestation. All creation is a gradual reduction of the infinite wave-length
of Consciousness. Creation is like an iceberg in the infinite ocean of Shiva-
Consciousness. Shiva is the ocean while Shakti is like the cool air that
freezes a part of the ocean and makes an iceberg. Both iceberg and ocean,
like creation and Consciousness, are of the same essence. The subtlest
aspects of creation are but finer vibrations of Shakti. The Macrocosmic
Mind is the first and subtlest expression to manifest out of the infinite ocean
of Shiva. Unlike pure Consciousness, Mind has the qualities of both Shiva
and Shakti. It is a tranquil, intelligent being like Shiva, but also an active
being like Shakti. It is through this Macrocosmic Mind that the material
universe manifests. Everything that exists is first conceived within this
great Mind that continues to guide the involution of Shiva into the material
expressions of the universe. The Mind of Brahma is GOD- Generator-
Operator-Destroyer. Brahma generates all creatures in its mind, they are
operated or sustained by this mind, and ultimately dissolved or “destroyed”
by this mind as all created things are impermanent.
Mind is the first-born progeny of Shiva-Shakti. Mind has two aspects,
the inner and the outer, or the subjective and the objective. Mind is a
complete entity that has the intelligence of Shiva and the creative energy
of Shakti. The inner, subjective chamber of mind is more like Shiva while
the outer, objective chamber of mind is more like Shakti. Mind is always a
balance between the inner conscious parts and the outer, created aspects.
One part remains near Shiva while another part, the objective, always
moves outward, into created expressions. Just as Shiva consciously guides
Shakti, the intelligence of the subjective chamber of mind always guides
the objective chamber of mind. The objective chamber of mind is called
chitta. Chitta is a mental “plasm” in which all of the created stuff in the
universe is contained. Chitta is like a plasma screen while the subjective
chamber of mind is the intelligence controlling how this mental plasma
behaves. The universe is the projected show within the objective, mental
plasma of the Mind of Brahma. It has no existence apart from mind just as
play of light and sound of a projected movie has no independent existence
apart from the LCD screen projecting it.
The creative action of Mind is like the cooling effect upon the iceberg.
Subtle waves of Shiva-Consciousness are transformed into mind and then
energy and eventually matter. What we call “matter” is but a projection ofthe objective mental plasm of Mind, the chitta. The universe and all matter
therein is but an idea in the mind of god. Matter is a spectrum of very fine
energies that eventually manifest in apparently solid form. There are 5
levels of material expression: ether, air, luminous, liquid, and solid. They
represent different degrees of the crudification of the objective mental
plasma. The subtler elements like “ether” or “air” aren't like space and
oxygen. They are very fine fields of energy behind matter and form. Their
subtlety is like “ether” or “air.” Matter has these very subtle, invisible
layers or “dark matter,” (the ether and air layers) as well as more
empirically quantifiable gross expressions (luminous, liquid, and solid) as
well. When matter reaches its most dense state in the core of a star, there
Shiva has reached his maximum state of density. Shakti cannot condense
Shiva's vibration any further and this phase of the involution of
Consciousness is complete. Shakti has awakened Shiva for the cosmic
dance of creation and has transformed the infinite, motionless Shiva into
the jagat or moving, living universe. Shiva is infinite and the creation of the
universe is just an imaginary transformation within Shiva’s infinity. Still,
Shiva remains as witness to the jagat. The universe is just waves on the
infinite ocean of Consciousness and always remains within Brahma.
Mind comes from Consciousness. Mind projects the physical universe
with its infinite creative power as Shakti has made all things from Shiva-
Consciousness. Life is the attempt to express the Macrocosmic Mind within
a physical structure like a little bubble within its own created universe. Life
resists entropy and organizes itself. It takes matter and energy from its
environment and puts them to its own use. Life, even in its simplest of
forms, is an intelligence created and guided by the Macrocosmic Mind of
Brahma that is sustaining the physical universe. Mind is something much
more subtle than any physical energy in the universe. It is the guiding and
sustaining force for biological life. Mind acting upon matter is a state of
organization and moves contrary to the force of entropy that governs the
material world.The intelligence of Shiva and the energy of Shakti are always behind
the phase of involution, of created expression. Shakti leads Shiva away
from his state of infinite oneness and non-duality. In the phase of evolution,
Shiva leads Shakti’s created activity, the universe, back toward his pure
state of Existence, Consciousness, and Bliss. Considering that there is such
an intelligent force as Brahma behind the physical world, it should be a little
easier to conceptualize that the physical world is not something static and
fixed and that matter is not an absolute state of existence. Matter is bound
Consciousness. Consciousness releases these bonds through the creation
of life. The second law of thermodynamics, the law of entropy, is but a
game that Shakti plays in the basement of her creation, this physical
universe. Behind this ephemeral, passing show is all the intelligence of all
of the anterior planes of existence that preceded and designed the
involution of the solid factor, or physical world. The physical world is but
the outermost ring of concentric circles around the Consciousness Nucleus
of Shiva. Shakti’s gravity and entropy are stronger in the physical world
where all of the impetus of creation has reached its nadir. Still and quiet,
Shiva remains the nucleus force behind all of the creation and is ultimately
the supreme creator and giver of life, which is but a spark of Shiva
Consciousness. Shiva is Hunab Ku, the center and nucleus of the universe.
Consciousness is the nucleus of all nuclei- galaxy centers, planets,
biological cells- all are the progeny of Brahma.
When the Macrocosmic Mind manifests as life in a physical structure
it is referred to as a microcosmic mind. The microcosm is but a bubble
within the unified Macrocosmic Mind. Recall that all creation is a projection
of the chitta, the objective mind. There is but one Mind that manifests in
many forms, like the reflection of one moon on many ponds. Life, or
evolution of Consciousness, is an attempt to retrace the steps of creation
generated in the phase of the involution of Consciousness where Shakti
manifested Shiva, and thus return to the original Shiva-Shakti union. Mind
has been lost, has been converted into Matter by the process of involution.
Mind lies latent within Matter waiting for the right moment to manifest itself
again. Mind is a vehicle for this bound Consciousness and uses
successively finer physical mediums to return to the essential state of unity
in Brahma. The evolution of biological life is the manifestation of the
microcosmic mind's evolutionary march toward re-union with Brahma.
Most expressions of life are still in the pre-conscious stage of
evolution. There is Consciousness, no doubt, as Shiva is behind all mental
expressions and therefore behind all expressions of biological life.
However, these entities are not entirely conscious of themselves. The
mind is still confined to the sensory, instinctual level. Only the chitta, or
objective, Sensory Mind has manifested. Chitta is the aspect of mind thattakes on the impression of the external world within the physical brain. It is
the outer part of mind that relates to the subtle life forces of the body. It
also regulates the physiological instincts that relate us to this sensory
world. The sensory organs transmit and impress external signals into the
chitta. Chitta is like a mental “plasm” or LCD screen that gives us a picture
show of external reality. The instincts inherent in the chitta respond to this
image and, in turn, act upon the motor organs in the brain to respond to the
external world. As life evolves the chitta becomes more complex as the
brain and nervous system have developed more refined instincts. Greater
degrees of intelligence begin to manifest through the refined chitta. Chitta
is the medium in which the mind responds to the determinism of the
external, sensory world but also the recipient of guiding intelligence from
the Macrocosmic Mind. Chitta, although grossly bound to a biological
entity, is still an aspect of the one, omniscient Macrocosmic Mind and it is
this mind that ultimately guides all evolution back toward union with
Brahma.
Undoubtedly, the most evolved intelligence of embodied, microcosmic
consciousness on this planet is the human mind. Here,self awareness is
clearly established. There is a sense of “I am” with a desire to discover
itself and grow mentally and spiritually. As the instincts of the chitta have
become very refined, the intelligence of the mind, the subjective chamber,
manifests. The subjective chamber of mind includes the active ego (Aham)
and the passive I-feeling (Mahat). Aham is the intelligence that says “I am”
and looks for ways to nourish, understand, and protect its identity. The
impressions created in the mind by the relationship between the nerve cells
and the mental chitta are witnessed by the subjective chamber of mind and
there is the thought that “I am walking by the river, there is an oak tree
with an agreeable smell. I think I will sit here for a while.” Here, the mind
isn't operating at the purely instinctual level of the Sensory Mind. There are
subtle thoughts, judgments, and impressions that act upon the more
objective mind or chitta. The Sensory Mind and chitta are always in the
present while the subjective chamber of mind may be very busy processing
experiences in the present, remembering the past, or creating imaginary
realities and fantasies with the help of memory and imagination. Because
subjective mind is the “I am,” the ego has many existential desires and
needs in the mental arena beyond the simple sensory world.
Consciousness comes from the infinite Shiva but now Consciousness is
bound within a human body, with a Sensory Mind, but even more complex
is the notion of “I am” with its intelligence and all of the needs and
potential experiences that will eventually awaken this limited, separate
notion of “I am” into union with Shiva.As human desires become more refined and meaning and purpose are
established, the self-concept of the Aham is cultivated. It is only due to the
natural flow of mental evolution that this limited Aham-ego concept desires
to expand into something still greater. When the separate ego begins to
wonder with creative imagination as to why some things are good and
beautiful and meaningful and seeks to increase these subtle, mental needs,
we encounter higher realities. We find greater levels of union with nature
and the social world, deeper levels of friendship and intimacy, and greater
wonder toward the great universe and everything in it. These higher
existential experiences break down our separateness and gradually make
us more universal citizens. Mahat, or the pure I-feeling, manifests when the
intelligence of the Aham is witnessed by something finer and more internal
than the Aham-intellect that is so occupied with the complex social world.
Mahat is the pure intuition of “I exist,” pure mindfulness. It is the purest
part of the subjective chamber of mind. It sees the intellect of the ego from
its quiescence deep within, beyond time. It is the closest approximation to
what one would call the “soul.” It is the inner light just behind the first
memory in childhood, your pure, inner “I” before it was impressed upon so
firmly by the outside world.
Experiences in the brain and chitta may
affect the ego, but the Mahat, the pure “I”, is never affected. It is the part
of you that just is, the finest part of your mental being. It is your personal,
dear and sweet feeling of pure existence that seems so special that it
belongs to you and no other. This deep feeling of “I” experientially reveals
immortality in that it is the key to feeling the Universal “I” that is within all
souls. It seems to be everywhere and in all people. A truly intelligent
microcosm that has properly cultivated the Aham-ego awareness will
always find the ground of their person here in the quiescent “I” of Mahat.
Shiva and the deepest part of the subjective chamber, the Mahat, are so
close in proximity and similarity it is practical to say they are identical. This
finest part of the mind, the Mahat, is a perfect replica of Shiva-
Consciousness. But Shiva is the witness even of Mahat, and is the lord of
the mind. Even though Mind bound itself in creation and has had to pass
through a phase of evolution to re-manifest itself, the fundamental
consciousness of Shiva has never changed. He has witnessed the entire
universal drama since its inception. The infinite ocean of Consciousness
sustains all things always. It is the fundamental identity or “I-Witness”
beyond the Mahat.

<strong>The Creation of the Cosmic Nucleus</strong>
Even in the unified godhead, beyond god and Om, there still exist the
centripetal and centrifugal forces of Shakti. They are eternal and infinite
and are really not different than Consciousness, or Shiva. Consciousness in
and of itself is everywhere at one with itself. There is no “here” or “there”.
There is nothing to move away from or toward when all is One. Therefore,
the centrifugal and centripetal forces of Divine Energy or Shakti are latent
in Shiva, in the godhead. Their being is only apparent once they are
activated. For the most mysterious of reasons the dormant Consciousness
of Shiva is not forming a nucleus and actively using its Citishakti, or force of
Consciousness to equalibriate these two forces and place its own
Consciousness as the Cosmic Nucleus. Here, it is as if the centripetal and
centrifugal forces are 2 giant asteriodal magnets that repel and attract
eachother but cannot form an orbital equilibrium. Instead, they collide and
become one. The centripetal and centrifugal forces are the latent energy in
Consciousness that can’t express themselves creatively until Consciousness
permits. Within the silence and unity of the godhead lies a primordial chaos
that may awaken into a sublime order if Consciousness permits.
When Consciousness forms a nucleus between these two forces, it must
itself give its essential Consciousness in such a way as to balance these two
energies. Here lies the secret in which the infinite Consciousness, the
godhead, apparently becomes god by giving its very own essence to the
creator god. Consciousness is responsible for the creation of the neutral
force between the centripetal and the centrifugal. Consciousness begins to
flow “outward” to the relationship between these introversial and
extroversial forces. This is the first stage of mimicry in which the created
expressions are reflections of the original being. The godhead descends into
god.
Recall that the centrifugal force is the positive force. It is a force of infinite
lightness and clarity. It is a feeling of infinite expansion, like when a child I
contemplated the mind-perplexing idea that space just goes on forever and
ever without end. In Tantra this is called the subtle or sattvic force of Shakti
and is the energy that expresses the purely subjective chamber of mind,
the Mahat. The subtle force is an energy of Shakti but whose influence over
consciousness is so fine that Consciousness isn’t perturbed. This energy is a
vehicle for Consciousness to express itself and remain in contact with the
Cosmic Nucleus. It is the force that guides the activity of the Cosmic
Nucleus. Shakti's subtle, sattvik force is the creative, yin force that the
Cosmic Nucleus uses to govern the movements of heaven.
The centripetal force is the negative force. “She” never wants to leave
Shiva Consciousness and brings any vibration that leaves His nucleus backto “Him.” She is in no way subordinate to the centrifugal force because She
always wins in the end by bringing all created vibrations back into full union
with the Cosmic Nucleus. In Tantra this energy is the static or tamasic force
of Shakti. In its essence it is not crude or degenerating, as in the external,
physical world, but static in the sense that She doesn’t want to permit any
“escape” or outward flow of Consciousness. She wants things to remain as
they always have been and always has a reaction waiting for every positive
action. She is the return, receptive, or yang force. In the created world She
permits beings to exist, but also can also recall them when necessary.
Without her there may be heaven but no earth. Her acts of “destruction” in
the outer world bring inertness and staticity, while her destruction in the
inner world is more like a dissolution of mental bondages that brings one
back to center.
The intelligence of any system, physical, mental, or spiritual, depends on a
form of nuclear intelligence. This nuclear intelligence is always sustained by
the balance of centripetal and centrifugal forces, and uses the neutral force
to achieve this. The neutral force has its mysterious origins in the
transcendental Consciousness. It only comes into existence when
Consciousness determines to create itself a nuclues. Shiva is awakened and
must be lord over the opposing centripetal and centrifugal, or negative and
positive forces. In Tantra this neutral force is called the mutative or rajaskik
energy of Shakti. This is the shakti behind the Aham. This force can decide
whether the flow of Consciousness is to move outward (avidya) or inward
(vidya) because this energy is under direct control of Consciousness who is
the only entity capable of bringing the positive and negative forces into
balance and thus forming a nucleus.
The inverted triangle represents the communion of these three forces as
the Causal Matrix. Shiva is a point in the middle, the Cosmic Nucleus. The
tension and flow of the 3 energies moving in a counter-clockwise vortex
creates the Om sound. Om is really A, U, and Ma, but all at once. “A” is the
Generation, “U” is the Operation and “Ma” is Destruction—GOD. Although
the triangle may be considered a yantra or conceptual abstraction,
“hearing” AUM is an experiential reality that mystically reveals these truths.
One “hears” GOD’s trinity of these 3 forces while your inherent
Consciousness in the godhead remains in silence, witnessing this play of
god- Generation, Operation, and Destruction.
The notion of a third force, the rajasik, only comes into question when
the cosmic nucleus comes into being. The rajasik force is the regulator
between the centrifugal and centripetal forces. It is Chitishakti, the power
of Consciousness over energy. In reality, it is not a third force, but the
effect of Consciousness intervening in the eternal interflow between the yin
and yang forces. There is no third force, it is actually the One who actsupon the Two. The tertiary system of sattvik, rajasik, and tamasik forces
applies to the tertiary system of mind as chitta, Aham, and Mahat. If we
consider that there really is no third force beyond the centrifugal and
centripetal forces, then we must logically admit that the Aham, the doer-I is
also not real. Anandamurti, when speaking of microvita, preferred to use
the binary system to describe the mind. Mind is divided into the objective
and subjective chambers. The Aham would be some imaginary place
between the inner subjective mind and the outer objective chamber, the
mental plasm, or chitta. The Aham is extraneous, it is only real as long as
we have a concept of authorship over the universe. Does your Aham digest
your food? Do you need the ego to authorize this activity? Conversely,
does your ego decide the deepest and most profound occurrences of grace
in human existence. That comes from deep within the subjective chamber
of mind. The ego can neither control completely the body nor the mind.
Ego is but an extraneous commentary on what already is. It is an energetic
by-product between the exchanges of centripetal and centrifugal energy.
Just as the 3 comes from the One acting over the centripetal and centrifugal
binary forces, so is the Aham but an expression of the One within the mind,
the entity created by the centripetal and centrifugal forces.
Numbers
Shakti is indeed the force or energy of Shiva. Shiva as an infinite body of
pure consciousness contains all potential expressions. Within Shiva is
latent that which eventually becomes this expressed universe when Shiva
allows His Shakti, His latent energy, to awaken Him. She is the womb of
creation from which the seed of Consciousness burgeons forth into
expression. The positive, centrifugal, or sattvik force of Shakti is in essence
the limitlessness and all-pervasive quality of Shiva. The negative,
centripetal, or tamasik force is the unity and inclusiveness of Shiva that
never allows Its great magnitude to fragment and break away from itself.
The positive force calls out, always expanding, toward the infinite. It never
reaches an end, its call to create is answered by Oneself via the negative
force and says “you are forever with me.” In essence the centrifugal force
never goes outward because there is nowhere to go when all is one. The
return or negative, centripetal force in essence doesn’t have to return
anywhere because there is nowhere to return to when you are always at
home. These two forces that only manifest as antagonistic at the beginning
of creation and really are aspects of Shiva, the Supreme Consciousness,
and can in no way be considered separate from It. They are the
fundamental qualities or potentialities that give rise to the creation of
Heaven and Earth. Shiva and Shakti are verily Brahma, the Supreme Entity.The positive force is the vastness of Brahma while the negative force
represents the togetherness and inclusiveness of Brahma. Only after they
are combined and held into some order with one dominating the other is
there really a question of subtlety or crudity. In Brahma, all is subtle and
the positive and negative forces flow back and forth and interchange into
each other eternally. This is the essential centrifugal-centripetal non-
distinction before the formation of a cosmic nucleus, where there is really
no difference between one and two, between I and Thou. This eternal,
uncreated union of Shiva and Shakti has often been termed the “Godhead”
by Western Mystics. Godhead is the source from which God comes.
If this great body of Consciousness with its infinite potential to create
decides to intervene and balance these two forces, Consciousness must
create a nuclear or neutral force to act as mediator to these two latent
forces. The rajasik, or neutral force is neutral in that Its awareness sees the
two potentials as One and pervades them both. As such, Shiva, as Witness
to these two forces, may stimulate and balance each one to create rhythms
and pulses flowing between them in which sometimes there is more
centripetal than centrifugal forces working and vice-verse. When creation
flows out of Brahma, the centrifugal force is greater, when creation flows
back to Brahma, the centripetal force is greater. This is Shiva's
fundamental activity as the cosmological hub or nucleus of the creation.
The neutral force only comes about as a result of Shiva’s descent from
pure, unexpressed Consciousness toward being the Witness of Creation.
This is precisely why the neutral force can be termed the nuclear force. The
witnessing activity of Shiva gets involved in the process of creation as He
creates a nucleus for Himself between the positive and negative forces.
Shiva remains pure consciousness but his Citishakti, or force of
Consciousness manifests as the nuclear force. The Supreme
Consciousness, Brahma governs all things that come into being not by any
special activity, but rather by simply being Itself. It is Consciousness and
not action that determines the ultimate state of being. By not being bound
by action, the cosmic nucleus may use its Citishakti, the neutral force that
controls the positive and the negative, to influence the eternal flow of
positivity and negativity that always cancel each other. Instead of the
eternal rise (positive) and compensatory fall(negative) aspects of the
original, virgin wave of shakti, the third principle, the neutral force, may
bring disequilibrium to the eternal, balanced wave of Shakti and allow the
positive force to be a little stronger and dominate the return or negative
aspect of the wave which would naturally cancel out the positive. The
neutral force, the Cosmic Nucleus is always in turiiya, is always unmanifest
but at the same time controls any sprout of activity from the positive forceneutral
Shiva-Witness
centripetal
centrifugalthat leaves the original yin-yang balance. At the same time the Cosmic
Nucleus allows the negative force to eventually bring back the positive
force and neutralize it into turiiya or allow it to go on and sport about a little
longer.
All depends on the will of the Cosmic Nucleus. The divine father, the
centrifugal, positive force and the divine mother, the centripetal, negative
force are never separated from anything in their creation. For them, there
is no “other” and they can always guide you outward into successful life, or
bring you back to the silence of their Shiva-Shakti union in the Godhead.
“Father” and “Mother” are ultimately misleading terms in that they are
never really separate, but human beings always seem to favor one over the
other, and so we are therefore in their play of interchange. To see them as
one, to bring the mental wave into silence, into the neutrality of the pure
Witness is the only liberation from this play of action and reaction.
With the manifestation of the neutral force holding together the positive
and the negative, we come to understand the Tantric significance of the
triangle. Imagine an inverted triangle. To the right the centrifugal
expansive force shoots out from the vertex below. The negative, returning
or centripetal force can be understood as the left line moving downward
and returning to the vertex from which the positive force flows outward. It
is but the rise and fall of a wave. The neutral force is the horizontal line
that connects the two angular lines and gives form and structure to this
Causal Matrix. Now that Shiva has created a balanced structure with Itself
as Nucleus, It may use its infinite potential of Consciousness as
imagination, as a process whereby this nuclear intelligence may create the
entire cosmological order; first within the triangle, as imagination, and later,
when the triangle “opens”, create the actual, expressed universe as a
reflection of the inner, imaginative triangle. This whole process is revealed
practically through “hearing” Om. The classic Tantric concept of the “A-Ka-
Tha” triangle is the science of understanding the inner dynamics of this
triangle. The 3 lines of the triangle are traditionally known as the lines of
Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva or Generator, Operator, and Destroyer-GOD.
Inside this triangle is pure imagination and music. There are so many
sounds and so many tones, a divine music behind this creation where these
first three principle expressions apparently move outward to create the
“ten-thousand things.”The Cosmic Nucleus
controls the positive
and negative forces
and thereby the
inner and outer flow
of Consciousness.
centripetal
centrifugal
Shiva-WitnessThe horizontal, neutral line has the capacity to consume the centrifugal and
centripetal forces back into pure Consciousness. Here, the triangle is
sustained and constantly flows back into itself. The triangle opens or loses
its essential stability when it creates the fourth principle, the subjective
mind or “I-feeling.” Within the triangle, the three forces- sattva, raja, and
tamas create and multiply amongst themselves in an infinite process of
reciprocal movements that continue ad infinitum. From the perspective of
the three forces, the eternal, infinite creation is the activity of the 3 forces
governing the essential 2 movements, the centripetal and the centrifugal.
This is the relationship between the binary and the tertiary stages. Just as
omnipotent Shiva now has added a third pulse(1-2-3, 1-2-3) to the original
binary pulse(1-2, 1-2), Shiva may continue to add a 4 th pulse (1-2-3-4, 1-2-
3-4) or 5 th pulse and so on.
Sometimes, when I am meditating by the river in San Cristobal and I hear
the distant church bells ringing, I think of the burgeoning, exploding
movement of creation out of the primordial triangle as the Son, the first
manifestation of the divine triangle. It shoots out in a brilliant white line
that, although expressed, imitates perfectly the Father, Shiva
Consciousness. This Eternal I is the eternal reflection of Shiva within all
created souls, the perfect reflection of inner divinity. This is a vertical line
that crosses the horizontal line of the triangle. The line runs vertically and
forms a cross from the nucleus within to an imaginary point above the
inverted triangle. The forth manifestation comes from the uncreated
nucleus but also flows out into creation. This outward flow of Christ
Consciousness always remembers its source and never gets lost in
unconsciousness, whether in Heaven or Earth. And because this new
dimension is created out of the Shiva-Shakti causal matrix, the eternal I, the
Christ Consciousness as a vehicle for the Cosmic Nucleus also takes one
back into the causal matrix, the Trinity Triangle.
This fourth point outside the triangle “opens” the triangle to form a square.
The three vertexes must accommodate another created principle “outside”
itself. So now the 3 vertexes in harmony amongst themselves must now
harmonize a 4th principle. What is important to remember is that this
fourth principle is really an idea conceived first within the triangle. Really,
all is within Brahma and it is only an idea from within Brahma that there
exists anything beyond the Trinity Triangle.
But once outside the triangle and in the square that surrounds the triangle
there is mind, and we must consider this 4 th principle. The power of the
fourth principle that forms the cross continues multiplying itself just as theprimordial triangle beget the cross as the son. A square surrounds a cross,
but the cross itself forms four more squares in the empty space surrounding
it. This Divine Image then multiplies itself by itself as it pours out into
creation. 4X4x4........and so on. Many inner maps to reality are based on
these essential numeric relationships. Astrology attempts to understand
the relationship of how the essential 3 becomes the created 4 with the 12
phases of the zodiac. The I-Ching and the Mayan Tzolkin are based on the
64 hexagrams or 64 Tzolkin, or 4x4x4. The problem with these sciences is
that one truly has to learn to count backward and first understand this
essential counting from a state of no-thing-ness, or Consciousness without
an object. To know the inner secret of things, one must first forget all
things. I think one must first see the unity of the omin-telepathic Atman
first, in silence, in the triangle sourrounded by Om. If you really need to
know anything else than this, Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva are all around.
